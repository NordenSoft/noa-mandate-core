/**
 * THE ENTRY-POINT REGISTRY — GENERATED FROM `src/index.ts`, NEVER HAND-MAINTAINED.
 *
 * WHY GENERATED. The controls this repository lost to H-03 were all hand-maintained lists that
 * silently stopped describing the code: a poison catalogue whose self-check exercised only
 * POISONS[0], an entry probe that fired its hostile getter zero times and passed, iterator poisons
 * aimed at a prototype that does not own `next`. Each reported health while measuring nothing. A
 * hand-written list of "the security-sensitive entry points" would be the next one — it would be
 * correct on the day it was written and wrong on the day someone added an export.
 *
 * So the list is DERIVED from the module's own export statements via the TypeScript compiler API,
 * written to `conformance/ENTRY-POINTS.md`, and diff-gated exactly like `conformance/MATRIX.md`.
 * The generator is the only author. Adding an export changes the generated file; CI fails until a
 * human has looked at the diff and committed it. Nobody can add a security-sensitive entry point
 * that nothing knows about.
 *
 *   node scripts/gen-entry-point-registry.mjs --write   regenerate the checked-in registry
 *   node scripts/gen-entry-point-registry.mjs           print it (used by the diff gate)
 *
 * CLASSIFICATION, AND WHY IT IS CONSERVATIVE. An entry point is SECURITY-SENSITIVE when its verdict
 * is something a caller makes a trust decision on, or when it consumes bytes an attacker controls.
 * Everything else is a PRODUCER (the signer's own data, trusted by definition — ADR §3.3) or a
 * UTILITY. The default for an UNRECOGNISED export is SECURITY_SENSITIVE, not utility: a new export
 * nobody has classified must fail closed, because the alternative is that the interesting case is
 * the one the list forgot.

  // ── INERT_CONSTRUCTOR — classified 2026-07-28, and this is the one judgement call in this file ──
  //
  // These six were never classified. They were SECURITY_SENSITIVE by the fail-closed default at the
  // top of this file — "a new export nobody has classified must fail closed" — which is the right
  // default and is not the same thing as a finding. Classifying them is what this table is for.
  //
  // WHY THEY ARE NOT VERIFIER BOUNDARIES. The test at the top of this file is "its verdict is
  // something a caller makes a trust decision on, or it consumes bytes an attacker controls".
  // Neither holds. `frozenTable`/`frozenSet`/`makeInertArray` are CONSTRUCTORS that run at
  // module-evaluation time over the module's OWN literal tables — the same relationship to their
  // input that `buildReceipt` has to the signer's data (ADR §3.3). `isInertArray`/`isFrozenSet` are
  // pure structural predicates. `inertViolations` is an AUDIT walker that returns a list of
  // findings; it is the MECHANISM of a control, not an input boundary.
  //
  // AND BYTES-IN WOULD NOT CLOSE THEM ANYWAY, WHICH IS THE ACTUAL ARGUMENT. Their subject is the
  // PROTOTYPE and MUTABILITY of a table this package constructs. Serializing that table to bytes and
  // parsing it back would produce a different table, not a safer one. ADR §4's summary row listing
  // them for deletion is wrong for the same reason: deleting them removes a control that nothing
  // replaces (§5.6 says so two sections later, and §5.6 is the reasoned text).
  //
  // THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT, STATED RATHER THAN OMITTED. Any exemption added during a migration whose
  // scoreboard is "violations to zero" is suspicious by construction, and this one moves the count
  // from 6 to 0. Two things are offered against that, neither of which is "trust me": the exemption
  // is MECHANICALLY CONSTRAINED below (it may only be claimed by exports of `src/inert.ts`, and only
  // while the control that enforces their invariant is present), and the file remains in the TCB, so
  // L2/L3 lint it exactly as before. Nothing else in any gate was touched to reach zero.

/**
 * Types that satisfy the ADR §3.1 boundary.
 *
 * ── THE DETECTOR WAS BLIND, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT (fixed 2026-07-28) ────────────────────────
 * This pattern was written against `Uint8Array`. TypeScript 5.7 made the type GENERIC over its
 * backing buffer (`interface Uint8Array<TArrayBuffer extends ArrayBufferLike = ArrayBufferLike>`),
 * so `checker.typeToString` now renders every occurrence as `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` and the
 * pattern matched NONE of them. Measured on the migrated tree: twelve entry points whose first
 * parameter is exactly `string | Uint8Array` were reported "NOT bytes-in".
 *
 * That is the H-03 shape once more, in the gate that exists to measure H-03: the rule was satisfied
 * and the instrument could not see it. It is worth being precise about the direction of the error,
 * because the opposite direction would have been far worse — a detector that under-reports
 * compliance makes work look unfinished, while one that over-reports it makes an unmigrated export
 * invisible. This fix must therefore not widen what counts as compliant by one character.
 *
 * NORMALISATION, NOT RELAXATION. The type argument of `Uint8Array<…>` names the backing buffer and
 * is constrained to `ArrayBufferLike`; it does not change what the value IS. So the type string is
 * normalised by erasing exactly that argument, and the ORIGINAL, unrelaxed pattern is then applied
 * to the result. `selfTestBytesIn()` below asserts both directions — every accepted form and a list
 * of near-misses that must stay rejected — and throws before the registry is written. A detector
 * with no self-test is the thing this file's own docstring warns about.
