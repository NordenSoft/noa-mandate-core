/**
 * lint-pr-title — the PR title is now a commit title on `main`, so it is gated like one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, precisely. On 2026-08-04 a commit titled `test` landed on `main` and cannot be
 * removed, because `main` is protected against force-pushes and the history is signed. The repo's
 * `squash_merge_commit_title` was `COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE`, which means *a single-commit PR takes the
 * COMMIT's title*. The setting is now `PR_TITLE`, so every squash on `main` inherits the PR title
 * verbatim — which moves the whole risk onto a field nothing was checking. This checks it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not require a Conventional-Commits type. Measured over
 * the last 40 commits, 18 titles carry no type — including recent, GOOD ones like
 * "ADR-0007: a phone can join a real relay — device-pairing enrolment, end to end". A type gate
 * would reject those and force worse titles, and a gate that blocks legitimate work is a gate a
 * human switches off — after which there is no gate at all (the gate-design rules). A missing type is reported
 * as ADVICE and exits 0.
 *
 * WHAT IT BLOCKS is the narrow class that actually produced the incident: a title that carries no
 * information. Placeholders, GitHub's auto-generated single-file-edit title, and lengths outside
 * what a commit subject can hold.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY. `--selftest` runs fixtures in BOTH directions — titles that MUST fail and titles
 * that MUST pass. The must-pass set is the important half: "test the verifier against hostile
 * input" is a legitimate title that a substring check would wrongly kill, so the placeholder test
 * is exact-match on the whole title, never a substring. CI runs `--selftest` BEFORE it judges a
 * real title; if the fixtures do not behave, the gate exits non-zero without rendering a verdict.
 * A check that cannot run and a check that passed must never share an exit code.
 *
 *   node scripts/lint-pr-title.mjs --title "<pr title>"
