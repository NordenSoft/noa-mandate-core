/**
 * PUBLISH TARBALL DEPENDENCY GATE — a published package must never carry a local-path dependency.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Internal packages depend on each other, and on the kernel, through local path references
 * (`file:../..`, `file:../adapter-core`) so that development and CI measure THIS repository's code
 * rather than a registry copy of it. That is correct for development and catastrophic for
 * publication: `npm install noa-mcp-adapter-core` on a consumer's machine would try to resolve
 * `file:../..` relative to THEIR node_modules and install whatever happens to sit two directories
 * up — or, more usually, fail outright. Either way the published artifact is broken.
 *
 * The publish workflow already rewrites these specifiers to registry ranges immediately before
 * `npm publish` (`npm pkg set dependencies.<name>=^<version>`). That rewrite was WRITE-ONLY: no
 * step ever confirmed it happened, or covered every dependency, or survived a new local dep being
 * added to a package the rewrite list did not mention. A rewrite nobody verifies is a hope.
 *
 * This gate closes that. It does not inspect the manifest on disk — it packs the ACTUAL TARBALL
 * npm would upload and reads the manifest out of it. That is the artifact a consumer receives, so
 * it is the only thing worth asserting about.
 *
 * FAILS IF: any dependency, optionalDependency, or peerDependency in the packed tarball resolves
 * to a local path (`file:`, `link:`, `portal:`, or a bare relative/absolute path).
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/lint-publish-tarball-deps.mjs --dir packages/adapter-core
 *   node scripts/lint-publish-tarball-deps.mjs --dir packages/adapter-core --expect-local
 *
 * `--expect-local` INVERTS the assertion: it requires that at least one local-path dependency IS
 * found. That is the self-test. Run against the development tree (where local paths are correct
 * and expected), it proves this gate actually detects them — so a green result from the normal
 * mode in the publish workflow means "the rewrite worked", not "the check silently passed
 * everything". A gate that has never been observed to fail is not known to be a gate.

/**
 * `--manifest` reads `package.json` ON DISK instead of packing a tarball, and exists for exactly
 * one caller: a package's own `prepublishOnly`.
 *
 * MEASURED, 2026-08-12. Wiring the normal (packing) mode into `prepublishOnly` produced a hook that
 * blocks EVERY publish, including a correct one: `npm publish` runs `prepublishOnly`, which runs
 * `npm pack` inside it, and the nested pack's output cannot be read back — the gate then fails
 * closed on "could not inspect the artifact", which is the right instinct and the wrong answer.
 * A release gate that can never pass is not a gate, it is an outage.
 *
 * So the two modes divide by WHERE they can run:
 *   default (`npm pack`)  the artifact itself. Standalone, in CI, where nesting is not a factor.
 *   `--manifest`          the file that is about to BE the artifact. No subprocess, so it is safe
 *                         inside a publish lifecycle.
 * The manifest is strictly weaker evidence than the tarball — it proves intent, not outcome — so
 * this flag never replaces the workflow's tarball gate. It is the last line of defence for the
 * case the workflow cannot cover at all: a human running `npm publish` by hand from a dev tree.
