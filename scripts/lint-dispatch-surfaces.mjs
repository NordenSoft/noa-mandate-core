/**
 * DISPATCH-SURFACE ENUMERATION — the C-04 / H-02 class, enforced at the source.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THIS PROTECTS:
 *
 *     Once an external operation has been INVOKED, no self-report by the executing party may
 *     establish that no side effect occurred. A determinate negative is emitted only where a party
 *     OTHER than the executed one observed the non-dispatch.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE-LEVEL REGISTRY AND NOT A TEST. C-04 and H-02 were four separate sites implementing
 * the same rule four times, three of them wrongly, and each fix closed one MECHANISM. A behavioural
 * test can only assert the invariant at surfaces someone remembered to write a test for; the next
 * dispatch surface is by definition the one nobody remembered. This enumerates the surfaces from
 * the SOURCE and fails when the set changes — so a new one cannot be added silently, and a
 * dispositioned one cannot vanish without the disposition being revisited.
 *
 * BIDIRECTIONAL RECONCILIATION. Both directions are errors:
 *   • a matched site that is NOT in the registry  → a new dispatch surface bypassed review;
 *   • a registry entry that matches NOTHING       → the registry is describing code that is gone,
 *                                                   which is how a hand-maintained matrix rots into
 *                                                   the poison-catalogue pathology (H-03).
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/lint-dispatch-surfaces.mjs [--warn]
 *       --warn  report findings and exit 0 (the P2 ratchet's warn-first stage)
