/**
 * STRANDED-BRANCH GATE — work that exists only on a branch nobody is landing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A pushed branch with no pull request can carry unreviewed product, security, or
 * planning work while emitting no signal on the default branch. Manual reconstruction is slow and
 * non-repeatable, so this gate derives the answer from repository and pull-request state.
 *
 * The root cause is not laziness, it is INVISIBILITY: a pushed branch with no pull request emits no
 * signal anywhere. CI never runs on it, no reviewer sees it, no dashboard lists it. It looks exactly
 * like finished work to the person who pushed it, because pushing is the last thing they did.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MEASURES. For every branch, one question with a mechanical answer:
 *
 *     Does this branch carry commits that are not in main, with no pull request to land them?
 *
 * A branch is STRANDED when all three hold:
 *   1. its tip is not an ancestor of main (it has commits main does not),
 *   2. no pull request exists for it — neither open nor merged nor closed,
 *   3. it is older than the grace period (default 3 days), so work in progress is not nagged.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not judge whether the CONTENT is already in main. A
 * squash-merged branch keeps commits main never took, and an old branch's lines can be superseded by
 * a better implementation. Both defeat naive line comparison. Content triage needs a human reading
 * the diff; this gate answers only the mechanically decidable visibility question.
 *
 * WHY "no PR at all" AND NOT "no OPEN PR". A closed-unmerged PR is a decision someone made and can be
 * read. A branch with no PR is not a decision, it is an omission — the only state where the work is
 * invisible to everyone including its author.
 *
 * THE FIX IT ASKS FOR IS ONE COMMAND. Open a draft PR the moment a branch is pushed:
 *     gh pr create --draft --fill
 * From that point the work is visible, CI runs on it, and this gate is silent.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/lint-stranded-branches.mjs                 # report + exit 1 if any
 *   node scripts/lint-stranded-branches.mjs --grace-days 7
 *   node scripts/lint-stranded-branches.mjs --warn-only     # report, always exit 0
 *   node scripts/lint-stranded-branches.mjs --selftest      # prove the gate can fail
 *
 * EXIT 0 clean · 1 stranded branches found · 2 the gate could not measure (fails closed, never
 * silently passes: an unreachable `gh` or a shallow clone means UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN is not GREEN).

 *
 * - `gh-pages` and `_site`: publishing targets, written by tooling, never merged into main by design.
 * - bot-managed prefixes: the bot opens its own PR; before it does, the branch is the bot's business.
 * - `gh-readonly-queue/`: GitHub's own merge-queue staging refs, deleted automatically.
 *
 * Publishing and merge-queue refs are excluded by exact name because they are tool-managed delivery
 * surfaces, not work branches. Broad patterns would hide real work and are intentionally forbidden.
