/**
 * L1–L7 — THE SOURCE-LEVEL SECURITY GATES (ADR §8.2).
 *
 * WHY SOURCE-LEVEL. H-03 proved the runtime controls reported health while measuring nothing: the
 * poison harness self-check exercised only `POISONS[0]`; the `verifyChain` entry probe supplied a
 * non-array, took the early rejection, fired its hostile getter ZERO times, and passed; three
 * iterator poisons targeted `%IteratorPrototype%` rather than the prototype that actually owns
 * `next` (`poisonActuallyBit:false`). A runtime catalogue asserts "these ~70 poisons do not flip
 * these fixtures" and is falsified by poison 71. A source lint asserts "no decision-path module
 * CONTAINS a construct that could dispatch through a mutable slot" — a property of the code,
 * checkable exhaustively, that fails closed on constructs nobody has thought of yet.
 *
 * ── THE RATCHET, AND WHY IT IS NOT A WEAKENED GATE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Several of these cannot block against the CURRENT tree, because the code they govern has not
 * been migrated yet (bytes-in is ADR Phase 1; the closed primitive set and null-prototype tables
 * are Phase 3). There are exactly two honest ways to ship a gate in that situation:
 *
 *   (a) weaken the rule until today's code passes — and then it passes forever, measuring nothing.
 *       That is the blind-gate pathology, reborn as a lint.
 *   (b) keep the rule at FULL STRENGTH and ratchet its ENFORCEMENT: report at full strength today,
 *       block the moment the count reaches zero, and never let the count rise again.
 *
 * This is (b). `mode: "warn"` never softens a check — it only decides whether findings exit
 * non-zero. Every warn-mode lint additionally carries a `budget`: the measured count of existing
 * violations. Exceeding the budget FAILS EVEN IN WARN MODE, so the number can only go down. When a
 * budget reaches 0 the lint is flipped to `mode: "block"` and the budget deleted.
 *

 * L2 and L3 saw nothing. A URL in a string literal is ordinary TypeScript, not an exotic construct,
 * so the gate's premise ("a property of the code, checkable exhaustively") was simply false. The
 * same ordering bug let `const OPEN = "/*";` swallow a block.
 *
 * My own self-test missed it because every case I wrote put the string and the call in DIFFERENT

/**
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY A LONGER REGEX WAS NOT AN OPTION.
 *
 * L8 was a LINE-BASED text scan. It shipped at BLOCK/0, was false-green within one round, was
 * extended with four more construct classes and four spelling evasions, shipped at BLOCK/0 again —
 * and round 4 measured it clean while SEVEN live dispatches sat in the TCB, one of them
 * (`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` at call time in `src/opts.ts:163`) on the options-validation
 * decision path and another (`new WeakSet()` in a parameter default in `src/inert.ts`) on the
 * policy-table audit path. Each round's answer had been another alternation; that strategy cannot
 * terminate, because the subject is a property of the PROGRAM and the instrument was reading
 * characters.
 *
 * The scan is now `scripts/lib/dispatch-ast.mjs`: a TypeScript compiler-API walk that matches on
 * NODE KINDS and RESOLVED SYMBOLS. Formatting is not information it consumes, so multi-line,
 * computed, optional-chained and globalThis-prefixed spellings are all the same node; and the type
 * checker answers "is this identifier the ambient global or one of ours?", which is the question no
 * text scan can ask — it removes the false negatives and the false positives at the same time.
 *
 * SCOPE IS UNCHANGED AND NOT NARROWED: every TCB file except `src/intrinsics.ts`, which is the
 * capture mechanism itself. What DID change is the load-time exemption. It used to be "only inspect
 * INDENTED lines" — a formatting proxy that a declaration at column 0 walked straight through. It is
 * now structural: a node is exempt only if no function-like ancestor DEFERS its evaluation, with an
 * IIFE at module level still counting as load-time and a PARAMETER DEFAULT correctly counting as
 * call-time. That is strictly more subject matter, not less.

 * RELAY RECONCILIATION — every file under `packages/relay/src` is either declared a decision path

 * This exists because QA measured the escape and it was not budget inflation: a NEW FILE containing
 * `structuredClone(`, `for…of`, `.includes(` and an array HOF left the count at exactly 39. And
 * REMOVING `file-store.ts` from the declared list — 20 of the 39 — dropped the count to 19 and the
 * gate exited 0, silently. The cheap way past L10 was never to raise the budget; it was to move a

 *
 * `scripts/lint-security-gates.mjs` already documented this exact failure for L2/L3 — "a hardcoded
 * subject list that nothing reconciles is the poison matrix again, wearing a different hat: correct
 * on the day it was written, silent thereafter" — and L10 shipped without it.
 *
 * RECONCILIATION FINDINGS ARE RETURNED SEPARATELY AND BLOCK OUTSIDE THE BUDGET, for the same reason

/**
 * Every TypeScript module under a root, RECURSIVELY, following symlinks.
 *
 * ── FOUR MEASURED BLIND SPOTS, FIXED 2026-07-30 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The previous body was one `readdirSync` at a single level, matching `.ts`, guarded by
 * `e.isFile()`. Each of those three choices was a hole, and all three were reproduced by planting a
 * file whose ONLY content is `allowed.includes(v)` — the exact construct L10 exists to find — and
 * watching the gate stay at `L10-reconcile BLOCKING 0` and `L10 38`, entirely green:
 *
 *   packages/relay/src/routes/decide.ts   subdirectory   not recursive        -> 0 findings
 *   packages/relay/src/decide.mts         .mts           extension not matched -> 0 findings
 *   packages/relay/src/evil-decide.ts     symlink        isFile() is FALSE     -> 0 findings
 *
 * A gate whose scan root can be stepped out of by making a folder is not a boundary. This is the
 * same shape as the escape `2c0af6f` closed one level up — there the cheap way past L10 was moving a
 * file out of the scanned package; here it is moving it one directory down inside the scanned
 * package. Both are "relocate the code, keep the number".
 *
 * `statSync` rather than `Dirent.isFile()` because it FOLLOWS the link: a symlink must be classified
 * like any other module. A dangling link is skipped (nothing to read), not fatal.
 *
 * `node_modules` and `dist` are excluded because they are build artefacts and dependencies, never
 * authored decision paths — and that exclusion is by NAME, so it cannot be widened by accident.

  // WHAT THE VERIFIER RESIDUE IS, item by item, because an unexplained budget is a scoreboard:
  //   • L2 11 = the module-level `const RE_… = /…/` DECLARATIONS. L2 is a per-line text scan with
  //     no load-time exemption, so it reports the capture mechanism itself — the same false
  //     positive the AST gate was built to stop making, which is why L8 does NOT report them. Each
  //     pattern is compiled once at module evaluation and is only ever matched through the
  //     kernel's captured `exec`; `RegExp.prototype.test` is deliberately NOT used, because `test`
  //     performs a dynamic `Get(re, "exec")` and a rewritten `exec` reaches straight through it.
  //   • L8 5 = `instanceof` on TYPE GATES (`x instanceof Uint8Array`, `e instanceof Error`). There
  //     is no captured brand check for a typed array, and both directions of a lying
  //     `Symbol.hasInstance` here are fail-closed: the value is refused, or it is converted by a
  //     captured binding that a substituted brand cannot redirect.
  //   • L8 3 = `String(...)` on the two reason strings and the reported trust-policy hash. `String`
  //     has no captured wrapper and is NOT interchangeable with template interpolation, which
  //     THROWS on a Symbol and would breach the totality rule these call sites exist to keep. All
  //     three are verdict-neutral: they build human-readable text and a reported hash, never a
  //     comparison.
  // The numbers may only fall, and they are written back here the day they are measured.

  //   cli.mjs (monitor) 18 -> 3   the three left are `process.stdout/stderr.write`. There is no
  //                              captured wrapper for `process` in src/intrinsics.ts, and the
  //                              pre-existing commands in the same file write the identical way;
  //                              inventing a local wrapper for one half of one file would be
  //                              cosmetics, not a control.
  //   der/tsq/client/verify/anchor-hash + the older CLI commands: the residue. These are modules
  //   that predate this coverage, and a budget is the documented way to bring code under a gate
  //   without either weakening the rule or blocking on a migration that has nothing to do with the
  //   change in hand — the same route adapter-core and mcp-proxy took at 355.
  // ROUND 2 MOVED IT DOWN AGAIN, and the route there is worth recording because it briefly went
  // UP. Closing the review's H5 added a real fail-closed path to the CLI (verify the presented
  // chain, refuse a partially-read history), and every refusal is a `process.stderr.write` +
  // `process.exit` pair the AST gate counts: 97 -> 102. Raising the budget to fit was the wrong
  // instinct and refusing to add the safety check was worse. Both were avoided by routing the
  // serialisation through the captured `jsonStringify` and collapsing every fatal exit in the file
  // into ONE `fail(code, msg)` helper — which is better code for its own sake and leaves the gate
  // at 95, two BELOW where the package entered.
  // The number may only fall. It is written back here the day it is measured.
