/**
 * L11 — INERT-BEFORE-WRITE. Every container that receives a `[[Set]]`-shaped write on a trusted
 * decision path must already be unreachable from `Object.prototype` when it takes that write.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT CLASS, AND WHY NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY COULD SEE IT ────────────────────────────
 * Writing into an ordinary `[]` or `{}` performs `[[Set]]`. `[[Set]]` WALKS THE RECEIVER'S PROTOTYPE
 * CHAIN, and an ordinary container's chain ends at the mutable `Object.prototype`. An accessor
 * installed at `Object.prototype["0"]` SWALLOWS the element write while `push` still bumps `length`.
 * Measured end to end through the public `preCheck`, on an honest, validated rule set:
 *
 *     snapshot: branded=true  length=1  own0=false
 *     preCheck over-threshold transfer -> ALLOW  (ruleFired=allow-all, approvalRuleFired=null)
 *
 * A branded, validated, EMPTY approval rule set, and a 7000-unit transfer forwarded with no human.
 * The realistic gadget is timed: poison at load, hole the container, withdraw the poison, serve.
 *
 * `packages/adapter-core/src/policy-change-guard.mjs:53-63` already wrote this mechanism down, and
 * the same comment states — verbatim — why the existing gates are structurally blind to it:
 *
 *     "L2/L8 model dispatch as a call or a read; they have no grammar for a write, so
 *      `policy-change-guard.mjs:93` appears in NONE of the 298 budgeted findings."
 *
 * That is the gates' own comment about themselves. `approval-rules.mjs` contributes ZERO findings to
 * either budget, so a green L2/L8 is not evidence about this class and never was. Three files got
 * fixed because a human happened to read them. This layer is the grammar for a write.
 *
 * ── THE THREE PROPERTIES THIS LAYER IS BUILT AROUND ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1. CREATION-TIME, NOT FILL-TIME. A container re-rooted AFTER being filled has already taken the
 *     poisoned write. `L11-B` is the separate finding for exactly that ordering, because the fix
 *     that shipped for this class once re-derived the house pattern and got the ordering wrong.
 *  2. NOT-ANALYSABLE MUST FAIL. `L11-D` is raised for a subject that cannot be read or parsed, for a
 *     derivation that comes back empty, and for an inventory that no longer describes the tree. An
 *     unreadable file and a clean file do NOT share an exit code here.
 *  3. IT MUST BE ABLE TO GO RED. `--selftest` drives the SAME analyser the gate calls over violating
 *     and honest fixtures, in memory AND on disk, and fails if any arm stops biting. The disk arm
 *     exists because an in-memory fixture cannot detect that DISCOVERY stopped reaching a file.
 *
 * ── THE WRITE SET, AND WHY IT IS THIS AND NOT LONGER ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only operations that perform `[[Set]]` with a key an attacker can pre-install on `Object.prototype`
 * are writes here:
 *   • assignment to a member expression (`=`, every compound form, `++`/`--`);
 *   • `push`/`unshift`/`splice`/`fill`/`copyWithin`/`sort`/`reverse`/`shift`, each of which the spec
 *     defines in terms of `Set(O, index, value, true)` — including through this repo's captured
 *     `arrayPush`/`arraySort`/… wrappers, which `_apply` the pristine method to the SAME receiver and
 *     therefore inherit the receiver's prototype chain unchanged;
 *   • `Object.assign` / the captured `objectAssign`, defined as `Set(to, key, value, true)`.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED, with the reason, because a false positive is how a gate earns the right to
 * be ignored:
 *   • `pop` — writes only `length`, an own property of every array, so no chain is walked;
 *   • array/object LITERALS and object SPREAD (`{...src}`) and `Array.prototype.map/filter/slice` —
 *     the spec builds all of them with `CreateDataPropertyOrThrow`, a `[[DefineOwnProperty]]`, which
 *     does not consult the prototype at all. `const a = [x, y]` is not a write in this grammar;
 *   • `Map.prototype.set` / `Set.prototype.add` — internal slots, not properties;
 *   • integer-indexed writes into a TypedArray — `IntegerIndexedElementSet` never walks the chain.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/lint-inert-containers.mjs             (blocking; exit 1 on any finding)
 *       node scripts/lint-inert-containers.mjs --selftest  (proves the layer goes RED, then GREEN)
 *       node scripts/lint-inert-containers.mjs --sites     (print every classified site, not just findings)

 * THE SCOPE, AND THE ARGUMENT FOR IT
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The repository already has two TCB inventories for these packages (`ADAPTER_CORE_TCB`,
 * `MCP_PROXY_TCB` in `scripts/lint-security-gates.mjs`). This layer does NOT use them as its
 * subject list, and the reason is the one `lint-trusted-roots.mjs` records about itself: a
 * hand-maintained subject list is only correct on the day it is written. Those two lists are
 * reconciled against the tree by a blocking lint, which is exactly why they are TRUSTWORTHY AS A
 * LOWER BOUND and useless as an upper one — a file legitimately classified OUT of a TCB (a
 * re-export surface, a demo downstream) is still a file where an ordinary container can be filled.
 *
 * So the subject set here is EVERY source file under a gated ROOT, discovered mechanically, and the
 * two TCB lists are read back at runtime and RECONCILED against it: if any TCB entry is not a
 * subject of this layer, that is an `L11-D` finding. The relationship is asserted every run rather
 * than believed. This layer therefore inherits none of the TCBs' membership omissions, and the only
 * judgement left to argue is the ROOT boundary below.
 *
 * WHY THE ROOT BOUNDARY IS WHERE IT IS. The two roots gated below are the two published packages the
 * blindness comment names, and the ones where the defect was reproduced end to end through a public
 * entry point. Every other root is inventoried with a stated reason and its site counts are MEASURED
 * AND PRINTED on every run — an un-gated root is visible here, never silent. That is the difference
 * between "out of scope" and "nobody looked".
