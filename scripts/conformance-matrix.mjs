/**
 * Derives a per-vector-class × per-implementation PASS/FAIL matrix FROM two independent sources —
 * it does not modify or duplicate either one's logic (per their role as the standing cross-impl
 * conformance proofs). This is the machine-checkable form of conformance/MATRIX.md; run it to
 * regenerate that file after adding/changing a vector.
 *
 *   1. impl-py/conformance.mjs's own stdout          -> TS + Python columns (in-memory vectors,
 *      explicitly [TS .../[PY verifier] tagged — unchanged from before this file grew 3 more columns).
 *   2. impl-go/conformance_test.sh, impl-rust/conformance.sh, impl-csharp/conformance.sh's own
 *      stdout -> Go + Rust + C# columns. These three are NOT run through impl-py/conformance.mjs;
 *      they are independently gated in CI's `five-verifier-conformance` job
 *      (.github/workflows/ci.yml) against python3 impl-py/noa_verify.py (ground truth) on a
 *      SEPARATE, FILE-BASED corpus (conformance/vectors/, conformance/golden/). Folding their
 *      output into this table required a SECOND classifier (FILE_VECTOR_CLASS_RULES below) because
 *      their case labels describe FILENAMES, not the [TS ...]/[PY verifier] tags CLASS_RULES was
 *      built for — see that section's header comment for why a file-based vector is deliberately
 *      LEFT UNCLASSIFIED (tracked separately, never forced into the nearest-sounding bucket) when no
 *      vector-class label genuinely matches its own documented purpose in scripts/gen-vectors.ts.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/conformance-matrix.mjs [--write] [--selftest]
 *   (no flag)  print the matrix to stdout, exit non-zero if any of the 4 underlying runs failed, any
 *              printed line could not be classified into one of the 10 vector classes (TS/Python
 *              only — see above), or a Go/Rust/C# run produced ZERO parseable result lines (the
 *              "ran but proved nothing" defect — see verifyLangExecuted()).
 *   --write    also (re)write conformance/MATRIX.md from the freshly-computed matrix.
 *   --selftest hermetic checks of the parsers/classifiers + the empty-runner guard (RED on a 0-line
 *              exit-0 fixture, GREEN on a real one) — no subprocess, no toolchain required. Run this
 *              before trusting a real run, same convention as scripts/lint-trusted-roots.mjs.
 *
 * Threshold for "conformant": an implementation is conformant for a vector class iff EVERY vector
 * run against it in that class produces the SAME verdict as its OWN comparison target. That target
 * is NOT "the TS reference" for all five columns — QA round 2 finding F3 caught this file's own
 * prose overclaiming it was. Python is compared DIRECTLY to TS (impl-py/conformance.mjs). Go, Rust
 * and C# are each compared DIRECTLY to PYTHON (their own conformance.sh/conformance_test.sh scripts,
 * ground truth = impl-py/noa_verify.py) — NOT directly to TS. The five-way agreement claim is real,
 * but it is a CHAIN of two direct comparisons (TS<->Python, Python<->{Go,Rust,C#}), not five
 * independent direct comparisons to TS. One mismatch anywhere in that chain fails the whole class for
 * the mismatching implementation — there is no partial credit, because a single silently-accepted
 * attack vector is a full security failure regardless of how many adjacent vectors still pass. This
 * threshold is identical in KIND for all five columns; only the comparison TARGET and the corpus each
 * column's PASS(n) count is drawn from differ (see the header note this script writes into
 * conformance/MATRIX.md).
