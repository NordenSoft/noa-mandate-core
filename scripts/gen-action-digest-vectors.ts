/**
 * Deterministic conformance-vector generator for `noa.action-digest/0.1` (docs/action-digest-spec.md).
 *
 * Output (`conformance/action-digest/vectors.json`) is COMMITTED so anyone can re-derive and diff it;
 * CI regenerates and fails on drift, so nothing here may depend on the clock, on randomness, or on
 * `generateKeyPair()`.
 *
 * GROUND TRUTH. Receipts are built by the kernel's own `buildReceipt` and grants are signed with the
 * §6 execution-grant domain tag, both under the FIXED seeded Ed25519 keys in
 * `test/federation/_seeded-keys.ts`. Every rejection vector is therefore a cryptographically
 * well-formed pair of documents that fails a SEMANTIC rule — never a broken blob. That distinction
 * is the whole value of a rejection corpus: a verifier can refuse garbage by accident.
 *
 * Each vector pins the SUBSTRING of the refusal reason it is testing. A rejection vector that only
 * asserts `ok:false` passes when an unrelated earlier check fires, which is how a corpus starts
 * measuring nothing while still going green.
