/**
 * lint-doc-truth — every claim-surface document is gated like one, not just the README.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, precisely. On 2026-08-06 the root README said `noa-receipt` **0.6.0** while the
 * registry served **0.6.2**, and it stated a total test count that had been counted by hand on one
 * afternoon. Neither was a lie when it was written; both became false while every test, lint and CI
 * job stayed green — because nothing in this repository read the README. A project whose entire
 * product is "a claim you can check mechanically" cannot have a front page that only a human ever
 * checks. This is that check.
 *
 * WHY IT NOW COVERS MORE THAN THE README. `SECURITY.md`'s supported-versions table drifted the exact
 * same way, for the exact same reason: nothing read it either. It stated `noa-receipt` **0.6.1** while
 * the registry served **0.6.2** (`git log -S'0.6.1' --oneline -- SECURITY.md`, `git show 634a043 --
 * SECURITY.md`), and it was corrected by hand in `634a043` (PR #41) — the same commit that built this
 * gate, which is the whole irony: the gate shipped one drift too late to catch the drift that
 * motivated it. `GATED_DOCUMENTS` below is the fix: one named list, judged by the same rules, so the
 * next SECURITY.md number is caught mechanically instead of by a future PR that happens to notice.
 *
 * WHAT IT VERIFIES, and each rule exists because the class it catches has actually occurred here:
 *
 *   1  VERSION LITERAL — any version number a gated document states next to a published package name
 *      must equal `npm view <pkg> version`. "Next to" covers two adjacency shapes: prose (`pkg@x.y.z`
 *      or `pkg x.y.z`) and a markdown table row where a cell is exactly the package name and the
 *      NEXT cell is the version. The table form exists because prose scanning provably cannot see it —
 *      `|`, cell padding and `**bold**` all break the prose regex, and that gap is exactly how
 *      SECURITY.md's supported-versions table drifted (`noa-receipt` 0.6.1 vs a 0.6.2 registry,
 *      corrected by hand in 634a043) without this gate — in its README-only form — ever having a
 *      chance to catch it. Self-updating shields.io badges state no literal at all and are therefore
 *      the recommended form; a literal that is currently CORRECT still earns advice, because it is a
 *      fact with a decay date.
 *   2  PUBLICATION CLAIM — every package a gated document presents as being on npm (badge or
 *      npmjs.com/package/<name> link) must actually resolve on the registry. Six manifests in
 *      `packages/` are non-private and unpublished; presenting one of them as installable is the
 *      same false-claim class pointing the other way.
 *   3  TEST COUNT — a hardcoded "N tests" is banned outright. There is no cheap machine source for
 *      it (the suites take minutes across nine packages), so the honest options are "derive it" or
 *      "do not state it", and this repository states it in CI instead. A number nobody can re-derive
 *      in under three minutes does not belong on the front page.
 *   4  RELATIVE LINKS — every relative link resolves to a file or directory that exists. A 404 in
 *      the README of a trust project is a small thing that looks exactly like a big thing.
 *   5  DERIVED COUNTS — "N attack vectors" / "N malformed vectors" / "N verifiers" are re-derived
 *      from the filesystem on every run. The README once carried `14` attack vectors for weeks after
 *      two were added; that is the whole reason these are counted rather than typed.
 *   6  RUNNABLE QUICKSTART — every ```bash block inside the `## 60-second quickstart` section is
 *      concatenated IN ORDER and executed in a fresh temp directory under `set -euo pipefail`. That
 *      is precisely what a reader does when they paste the blocks into one terminal, which is why
 *      the blocks are concatenated rather than run in isolation: `cd` in block 1 must still be in
 *      effect for block 3, exactly as it is for the human.
 *   7  npx FOOTGUN — the CLI binary is named `noa`, but the npm package named `noa` belongs to an
 *      unrelated third party (an MVC library, maintainer `jsz1`). `npx noa verify …` therefore
 *      downloads and runs a stranger's package. The README said exactly that for months. Banned.
 *   8  LICENSE PARITY — a license badge must name the license in the root manifest.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not judge prose, tone, structure or completeness, and it
 * does not require a document to make any particular claim. A rule that fires on a claim a document
 * does not make would be a content mandate, not a truth gate. The consequence is stated plainly so
 * nobody mistakes it for coverage: DELETING a claim always satisfies this gate. It stops false
 * statements, never missing ones — except for the quickstart, where an empty or gutted section is an
 * explicit failure (rule 6's anti-vacuity floor) ON A DOCUMENT THAT CLAIMS ONE, because "the runnable
 * proof ran" and "there was nothing to run" must never share an exit code. Whether a document is
 * REQUIRED to carry a quickstart at all is a per-document fact (`requireQuickstart` in
 * `GATED_DOCUMENTS`, true only for the README) — a document that never promises 60-second onboarding
 * is not held to a standard it never claimed, but the moment it grows a `## 60-second quickstart`
 * heading, the same anti-vacuity floor applies to it too.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY. `--selftest` runs fixtures in BOTH directions against injected facts — no network,
 * no filesystem, no shell. Every finding carries a `[rule-id]` tag and every must-FAIL fixture
 * declares WHICH rule it is there to prove, so the selftest asserts the triggered rule set is
 * EXACTLY that one. Without this, a fixture can pass for a reason unrelated to the rule it was
 * written for — measured here: `9 attack vectors and 8 malformed vectors` was written to isolate the
 * malformed counter and was actually caught by the attack counter, so deleting the malformed rule
 * outright would have left the suite green. The must-PASS half is the other important one:
 * `noa.receipt/0.1` is a spec id
 * and not a package version, `ADR-0002` is not a version, `0.2.0 (breaking)` in a changelog note is
 * not a package version claim, and the sentence WARNING about `npx noa` must not itself trip the
 * `npx noa` ban. A lazy implementation passes the must-fail half and silently blocks every honest
 * README; that failure looks identical to a working gate until someone switches it off (the gate-design rules).
 * CI runs `--selftest` BEFORE it judges any real document: a check that could not run and a check that
 * passed must never share an exit code.
 *
 *   node scripts/lint-doc-truth.mjs             # judge every document in GATED_DOCUMENTS (network + shell)
 *   node scripts/lint-doc-truth.mjs --selftest  # hermetic fixtures, both directions
 *
 * Exit: 0 all documents clean · 1 findings on at least one document · 2 the gate could not run on at
 * least one document (selftest failure, registry unreachable, a document missing) — 2 always wins over
 * 1, and 1 always wins over 0, so a setup failure on the second document is never masked by a clean
 * first one.
