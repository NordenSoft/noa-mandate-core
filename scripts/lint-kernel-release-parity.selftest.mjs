// Selftest for the kernel release-parity gate.
//
// The gate exists because two earlier versions of it reported green while blind. So it does not get
// to be trusted on inspection: every case below builds a throwaway git repository, runs the REAL
// gate against it, and asserts the verdict.
//
// The six ATTACK cases are the ones a cross-family review used to defeat the previous version. They
// are kept verbatim rather than paraphrased — a regression test written from the fix instead of from
// the attack tends to test the fix.
//
// CONTROLS are not optional. A gate that only ever fails is exactly as useless as one that only ever
// passes, and "it refused" proves nothing unless the same harness can also produce an acceptance.
//
// Attack 2 (a force-moved tag) is NOT here and cannot be: git agrees with itself about a moved tag,
// so only the registry tier can see it, and that tier needs a real published package. It is exercised
// on every real run instead. This file says so rather than quietly covering five of six and printing
// a number that reads like all of them.
//
