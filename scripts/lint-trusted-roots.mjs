/**
 * L9 — TRUSTED SOURCE ROOT INVENTORY, and the forbidden trust-input patterns.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `scripts/lint-security-gates.mjs:275` is `walk("src")`, and that file contains
 * ZERO `packages/` paths. So all nine classifying layers L0-L8 are structurally blind to every source
 * root except the receipt kernel -- including `packages/gate/src`, where ALLOW/DENY is actually decided.
 * Eight measured defects lived there while the gate suite reported a blocking zero
 * (`docs/GATE-PROVENANCE-FINDINGS-2026-07-30.md`).
 *
 * The existing gate predicted this failure about itself, in the comment above its own `OUT_OF_TCB`:
 *
 *     "A hardcoded subject list that nothing reconciles is the poison matrix again, wearing a
 *      different hat: correct on the day it was written, silent thereafter."
 *
 * That list reconciles `src/` only. It described its own defect and could not see it, because nothing
 * reconciled the set of ROOTS. This layer reconciles the roots.
 *
 * Run:  node scripts/lint-trusted-roots.mjs             (blocking; exit 1 on any finding)
 *       node scripts/lint-trusted-roots.mjs --selftest  (proves the layer goes RED, then GREEN)

 * Every SOURCE file in a root.

 * WAY IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. `isCritical()` decides whether a root is security-critical by scanning this
 * list for CRITICAL_MARKERS. Five packages ship ZERO `.ts` files and only `.mjs`:
 *
 *     packages/signer-sidecar/src        0 .ts   2 .mjs     <- SIGNING
 *     packages/adapter-core/src          0 .ts  16 .mjs

 *     packages/framework-adapters/src    0 .ts   4 .mjs
 *
 * So `isCritical()` read ZERO files for each, found no markers, and this gate PRINTED them as
 * "not security-critical" — an AFFIRMATIVE clearance produced by not looking. That is worse than an
 * omission: an omission reads as a gap, a printed "not security-critical" reads as evidence. The
 * docstring at the top of this file quotes the PREVIOUS gate predicting this about itself ("correct on
 * the day it was written, silent thereafter") — and then this function did it again one layer down,
 * because "source file" was silently defined as "TypeScript file".

/**
 * Identifiers that provably hold a PARSE SNAPSHOT rather than a live caller object.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS — L9-D FIRED ON THE FIX (ADR-0005 Slice 1, 2026-07-30). L9-D watches for
 * "serialized for authentication, then RE-READ", because `encodeDocument` is `JSON.stringify` and
 * invokes accessors. That is the right thing to watch while the serialized value is CALLER-OWNED.
 *
 * But the CORRECT post-Slice-1 shape is, necessarily, that exact textual pattern:
 *
 *     const daBytes = encodeDocument(daDoc);      // daDoc is the PARSE of the request bytes
 *     verifyArtifact(daBytes, …);
 *     const decisionVal = daDoc["decision"];      // read the snapshot — the whole point
 *
 * `daDoc` came out of `parseDocument`, so it is frozen, null-prototype and accessor-free: re-reading
 * it cannot disagree with the serialization, by construction. Left unfixed, L9-D would report a
 * finding against every correct call site forever — and this file's own docstring already names why
 * that is worse than no gate at all: "a gate that cannot tell code from a string produces findings a
 * maintainer learns to dismiss, and a dismissed gate is worse than no gate."
 *
 * SEED + TRANSITIVE CLOSURE: an identifier bound from `parseDocument`/`parseBody`, plus anything bound
 * from an expression mentioning such an identifier, to a fixed point. The two-hop case is real and had
 * to be handled — `engine.ts` binds `parsedBody` → `daDocRaw` → `daDoc`.
 *
 * KNOWN BLIND SPOT, STATED RATHER THAN GLOSSED: this is a textual approximation of provenance, not
 * dataflow. An expression that MIXES a snapshot with a live object (`{ ...daDoc, ...liveObj }`) taints
 * as a snapshot and would be skipped. That is a narrow hole and a deliberate trade against firing on
 * all correct code; closing it properly needs the AST pass L8 already does for dispatch surfaces. The
 * `--selftest` below pins that L9-D still FIRES on a plainly live object, so this relaxation cannot
 * silently turn the layer off — which is the failure mode that would actually matter.
