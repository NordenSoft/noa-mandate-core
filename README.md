# NOA — Agent Action Receipt

> The Apache-licensed NOA receipt kernel: protocol, reference implementations, and
> conformance artifacts for independently built integrations.

**NOA Receipt is an open protocol for signed, independently verifiable receipts of AI-agent
actions: before an agent does something real, a governance layer decides *allow · hold for a human ·
block*, and emits a tamper-evident, hash-chained record that anyone can verify offline — no account,
no network, no dependency on us.** This repository is the kernel: the protocol, the reference
implementations, and the conformance suite that holds each of them to the identical verdict on every
vector it is run against — which is not every vector for every implementation, and the matrix says
per class exactly which.

**One concrete case.** An agent wired to a payments tool decides to send 7,000 — pick whichever
currency you like; the rule is written against the amount, not the symbol. The call never reaches the
payments tool: the proxy in front of it holds the call and writes a signed `DEFERRED` receipt
instead. A request goes to the configured approver client, and the session stays blocked apart from
the one exact retry, which goes through only after a holder of that key has signed. If nobody signs,
the call is never forwarded.
When someone does sign, the chain reads `DEFERRED → ALLOWED → EXECUTED`, each link signed and
hash-chained onto the one before it. Six months later, when someone disputes that the transfer was
ever authorized at all, the other side can check that chain offline — no account, no network, nothing
to ask us for — and it states which agent, which action, the hash of the exact parameters, which
approver identifier signed, and in which order.

**The ceiling on that case, in plain words.** What the chain establishes is that a key holder
approved *this exact intent* before the call was allowed through. It does not establish what the
payments tool then did: this system never watches the executor, and the remote system of record is
the only witness to a side effect (NC-1.3). So the code emits a reason code that says as much,
rather than a friendlier one — `HUMAN_APPROVED_INTENT_NOT_EXECUTION_BOUND`, approval of an intent,
without binding to the execution that follows (NC-6.6). The plain `HUMAN_APPROVED` token stays
reserved in the union, is emitted by nothing, and a test fails if anything starts emitting it. Two
further edges belong in the same breath: the approver identifier is an opaque string, and binding it
to a real person is your identity system's job rather than ours (NC-3.2); and what is gated is the
path through the proxy, so an agent that can reach the payments tool by another route was never
inside this boundary (NC-6.6). Every one of those codes is a numbered, normative entry in
[NON-CLAIMS.md](NON-CLAIMS.md).

## 60-second quickstart

Copy-paste, in an empty directory. Nothing here contacts NOA, and every block below is executed by
CI on every push — if one of them stops working, the build goes red.

```bash
mkdir -p noa-quickstart && cd noa-quickstart
npm init -y > /dev/null
npm install noa-receipt        # no runtime dependencies; Node >= 20 stdlib only
```

```bash
# Sign a receipt for an action, then write the chain and the PUBLIC keyring to disk.
node --input-type=module <<'EOF'
import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { generateKeyPair, buildReceipt } from "noa-receipt";

const kp = generateKeyPair("demo-key-1");

const receipt = buildReceipt(
  {
    id: "rcpt_0",
    ts: new Date().toISOString(),
    scope: { chain: "quickstart:demo" },
    agent: { id: "quickstart-agent", model: "vendor/model-v1", principal: "SERVICE" },
    action: {
      id: "payment.refund",
      canonical: "payment.refund",
      riskClass: "LOW",
      paramsHash: "sha256:" + "0".repeat(64), // never carry raw params — only their hash
      reversible: false,
      rollbackRef: null,
    },
    governance: { mode: "on", verdict: "EXECUTED", ruleId: "low-risk-auto", approval: null, sandboxed: false },
  },
  null,                                        // no previous receipt: this is the genesis of the chain
  { kid: kp.kid, privateKey: kp.privateKey },
);

writeFileSync("chain.json", JSON.stringify([receipt], null, 2));
writeFileSync("keyring.json", JSON.stringify({ [kp.kid]: kp.publicKey }, null, 2));
console.log("wrote chain.json + keyring.json");
EOF
```

```bash
# Verify it offline, in a separate process. Prints status VALID and exits 0.
./node_modules/.bin/noa verify chain.json --keyring keyring.json
```

```bash
# Now alter one field of the signed record and watch the chain reject it.
sed 's/"quickstart-agent"/"someone-elses-agent"/' chain.json > tampered.json
if ./node_modules/.bin/noa verify tampered.json --keyring keyring.json; then
  echo "UNEXPECTED: a tampered chain verified"; exit 1
else
  echo "rejected as expected, exit code $? (2 = TAMPERED)"
fi
```

Exit codes are CI-ready: `0` VALID · `1` UNVERIFIED (no keyring supplied) · `2` TAMPERED · `3`
MALFORMED · `4` usage · `5` UNTRUSTED (identity binding failed) · `6` witness quorum incomplete.
Historical mode additionally uses `7` for an authenticated checkpoint conflict and `8` for
cryptographic integrity failure, so shell consumers do not have to relabel either as legacy
`TAMPERED` or `MALFORMED`.

> ⚠ **The CLI binary is called `noa`, but the npm package named `noa` is not ours** — it belongs to

The verifier is honest about its own limits in the same output: without a keyring it will not claim
VALID, and without a checkpoint it *warns* that tail-truncation cannot be detected offline.

## Historical verification after key retirement

`verifyHistoricalChain` and CLI `--purpose historical` are the versioned
`noa.historical-verification/0.1` side contract. They retain a lifecycle key's public material to
check old receipt bytes while leaving `verifyChain` and every current-use authorization surface
fail-closed on a retired key. A historical checkpoint is authenticated only through the separately
supplied `checkpointKeyring`; receipt trust is never a fallback. Its signing key must also differ
from every receipt signer by both key ID and decoded SPKI bytes. Separate keys do not establish
separate organizations, so `organizationalIndependence` remains `UNVERIFIED`.

An authenticated checkpoint over the presented head yields `HEAD_ANCHORED`; one over a real lower
receipt yields `PREFIX_ANCHORED`. The latter has top-level classification `PARTIAL`, which is the
stable replacement for the earlier informal `DEGRADED` label. A checkpoint at or after a covered
signer's `retiredAt` is `UNATTRIBUTABLE`; attribution requires the checkpoint to strictly predate
retirement. When the lifecycle explicitly supplies `validFrom`, attribution also requires
`validFrom <= checkpoint.ts`; equality is valid. The full interval is therefore
`[validFrom, retiredAt)`. The legacy two-field `{publicKey, retiredAt}` entry remains valid and has
no lower bound: verifiers do not invent activation history. An explicit empty or inverted interval
(`validFrom >= retiredAt`) is rejected as `RECEIPT_ROOT_INVALID`.

The checkpoint key's own explicit `validFrom` is also an inclusive lower bound on
`checkpoint.ts`. A checkpoint before either activation bound is `UNVERIFIED` with
`CHECKPOINT_BEFORE_ACTIVATION`; integrity and the authenticated head/prefix mapping remain intact,
but attribution is withheld. Absent/null checkpoint-key activation retains the unbounded legacy
behavior. A lifecycle-retired checkpoint key remains `WITNESS_KEY_RETIRED`: its own signed
timestamp cannot prove that it existed before that key was retired.

Lifecycle and checkpoint instants use the receipt profile's RFC 3339 grammar: one to nine fractional
digits are accepted, and RFC 3339's `T`/`Z` separators are case-insensitive (`t`/`z` are valid).
Comparisons retain nanosecond precision. A checkpoint ahead of the supplied bytes or contradicting
the hash at its sequence is `CONFLICT`. Missing bytes are reported as
`MISSING_RELATIVE_TO_CHECKPOINT`; the API never infers deliberate suppression without separate
presenter-possession/omission evidence.

```bash
node dist/src/cli.js verify conformance/survivable-retirement/chain.json \
  --purpose historical \
  --keyring conformance/survivable-retirement/receipt-keyring-retired.json \
  --checkpoint conformance/survivable-retirement/checkpoints/exact-before-retirement.json \
  --checkpoint-keyring conformance/survivable-retirement/checkpoint-keyring.json
```

The canonical corpus is regenerated by `npm test`; `npm run check:survivable-retirement` requires
the same versioned result and process exit from TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, and C#.

## How it works

- **Decide before, not observe after.** A policy classifies an action — safe, risky, forbidden — and
  the governance layer allows it, holds it for a human, or blocks it.
- **Commit to the decision.** A receipt records *which agent · what action · under which policy ·
  what verdict · reversible how*, signed with Ed25519. Signatures are mandatory and the signing key
  is bound into the hash.
- **Chain it.** Each receipt link-hashes the previous one, so altering any past record breaks every
  record after it.
- **Never carry raw parameters.** Only `action.paramsHash` travels, so a receipt is publishable
  without leaking the payload.
- **Verify anywhere.** Verification is a pure function of bytes: offline, no account, no network.
  Five language-specific verifier implementations are checked for cross-implementation verdict
  parity through a two-hop comparison chain (Python against the TypeScript reference; Go, Rust,
  and C# against Python). The exact coverage and caveats are in
  [`conformance/MATRIX.md`](conformance/MATRIX.md); organizational and implementation independence
  are not established.

## What we deliberately do NOT claim

This is the part of the project that took the most engineering to be able to state precisely, and it
is normative: **[NON-CLAIMS.md](NON-CLAIMS.md)**. Past overclaims are not edited away — they are kept
in [CORRECTIONS.md](CORRECTIONS.md).

- A signature proves *someone said this*, never *this is true* (NC-1.1) and never *this is still
  true* (NC-1.2).
- A receipt does **not** prove the described action actually occurred; the remote system of record is
  the only witness to a side effect, and it does not sign our receipts (NC-1.3).
- A valid chain does **not** prove completeness — it cannot prove no receipt was withheld (NC-1.5).
- An approval proves a key holder authorized these bytes; not that a human understood them (NC-3.1),
  and not that the approval screen was ever rendered (NC-3.4).
- The same-realm TypeScript verifier does **not** meet the security objective against an attacker who
  runs code in your process; the separate-process CLI is what holds today (NC-6.0, NC-6.2).
- A verdict handed back to a compromised caller is **not** an enforcement control (NC-6.6).
- No certification is claimed or in progress — no SOC 2, no ISO 27001, no FedRAMP (NC-5.3).
- `v1.0` does **not** claim external anchoring; nothing here contacts a witness or a log (NC-4.3,
  NC-4.5).

## What is live, and what is roadmap

**Live — measured in this repository, gated on every push:**

- The `noa.receipt/0.1` wire format, **frozen**, with a JSON Schema and a published spec.
- Three packages on npm under Apache-2.0 (the badges above are the live versions).
- **Five language-specific verifier implementations** checked for cross-implementation verdict
  parity through a two-hop comparison chain in CI — Python against the TypeScript reference, then
  Go, Rust, and C# against Python, with no partial credit per vector class. This does not establish
  organizational or implementation independence; see
  [`conformance/MATRIX.md`](conformance/MATRIX.md).
- A conformance corpus of **21** attack vectors and **9** malformed vectors that the verifiers must
  reject on every push — plus the companions that must keep *passing*, because a rule that refuses
  everything is an outage rather than a control — with the per-class coverage, and the three classes
  (`hash`, `impersonation`, `dup-key`) the cross-implementation runner does not explicitly tag for
  TypeScript, written down in `conformance/MATRIX.md` rather than glossed.
- An offline CLI verifier that runs in its own process with no third-party dependencies.
- A runtime human-approval gate in the MCP proxy: a risky call is held as a signed `DEFERRED`
  receipt until a human approves it, producing a `DEFERRED → ALLOWED → EXECUTED` chain
  (`--approval-rules`).

**Roadmap — specified, decided or planned, and NOT shipped.** The public decision roadmap is
[04_ROADMAP.md](04_ROADMAP.md); it is not release evidence for any particular revision.

- A semantic interoperability contract for consumers, and an externally reproducible conformance
  profile (roadmap §1–§2).
- Resolution of the documented protocol-quality gaps — canonical encoding, COSE companion behaviour,
  error taxonomy, key lifecycle, revocation and freshness (§3).
- Standards engagement. An individual Internet-Draft `-00` exists; that is **not** working-group
  adoption, and this project does not call itself standardized (§4).
- A controlled pilot with a real relying-party decision. Package downloads are distribution evidence,
  never adoption evidence (§5).
Repository-artifact status: `PROTOTYPE`, with active `SPECIFICATION` work. This is not evidence of
`PILOT`, `STANDARDIZATION`, or `PRODUCTION` status.

## Packages

| Package | npm | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `noa-receipt` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noa-receipt) | The kernel: build, sign, hash-chain and verify receipts, plus the `noa verify` CLI. No runtime dependencies. |
| `noa-mcp-adapter-core` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noa-mcp-adapter-core) | The shared pre-flight decision engine — one `preCheck()` every MCP integration calls instead of re-deriving the policy. |
| `noa-mcp-proxy` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noa-mcp-proxy) | A transparent MCP proxy in front of an existing, unmodified tool server: reflects its tool surface and gates every `tools/call`, fail-closed. |

Further modules live under [`packages/`](packages/) — gate, relay, evidence, approval artifacts,
framework adapters, signer sidecar, TSA anchor. They are part of this repository's gates but are
**not published to npm**, and this README does not present them as if they were.

## Language-specific verifier implementations

Five verifiers are held to one bar: for every conformance vector an implementation
must produce the **identical verdict** to its own comparison target — a two-hop chain, not five direct
comparisons to TypeScript: Python is compared directly to the TS reference, and Go, Rust and C# are
each compared directly to Python (not to TS), exactly as the table below and
[`conformance/MATRIX.md`](conformance/MATRIX.md) state. One mismatch fails the whole class for that
implementation — no partial credit, because a single silently-accepted attack is a complete security
failure regardless of how many adjacent checks still pass.

| Implementation | Path | Conformance parity |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript (reference) | [`src/`](src/) | Emits the signed vectors; agreement with the Python verifier is asserted on every push ([`impl-py/conformance.mjs`](impl-py/conformance.mjs)). |
| Python | [`impl-py/`](impl-py/) | Own JCS, own from-scratch RFC 8032 Ed25519, zero shared crypto with TS. Ground truth for the Go, Rust and C# verifiers below. |
| Go | [`impl-go/`](impl-go/) | Exit code must match the Python reference on every vector ([`impl-go/conformance_test.sh`](impl-go/conformance_test.sh)). |
| Rust | [`impl-rust/`](impl-rust/) | Same bar, same corpus ([`impl-rust/conformance.sh`](impl-rust/conformance.sh)). |
| C# | [`impl-csharp/`](impl-csharp/) | Same bar, same corpus ([`impl-csharp/conformance.sh`](impl-csharp/conformance.sh)). |

All five run in the `five-verifier-conformance` job of
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) on every push and pull request. This proves
cross-implementation verdict parity for the covered vectors and comparison topology. Organizational
independence and independent decision paths are not established, so this repository does not claim
independent implementations.

## Working in this repository

```
npm ci
npm run build                  # tsc
npm test                       # build + regenerate vectors + the kernel suite
node dist/src/cli.js verify conformance/vectors/valid-chain.json \
  --keyring conformance/vectors/keyring.json \
  --checkpoint conformance/vectors/checkpoint.json
```

Test counts are deliberately **not** printed in this file: a number here would be stale the day after
it was typed, and the doc-truth gate rejects one. CI is the live count.
