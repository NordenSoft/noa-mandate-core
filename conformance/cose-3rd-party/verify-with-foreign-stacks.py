# Independent 3rd-party verification of a NOA COSE_Sign1 -19 envelope.
#
# This header used to read 'SCRATCH (gitignored _*)'. Both halves were false: the repository's
# ignore rules covered _*.mjs and _*.ts but never _*.py, so this file was tracked and public
# while telling every reader it was neither. It is now a tracked conformance artifact, named
# and placed like one, and the ignore rules have been extended so the next _*.py really is
# ignored. See README.md in this directory for what it proves and how to re-run it.
# Two independent stacks, neither is NOA code:
#   (A) pycose 1.1.0 — does it recognize/decode the COSE_Sign1 structure and read alg=-19?
#   (B) cbor2 + cryptography (PyCA) — independently reconstruct RFC 9052 Sig_structure and
#       verify the Ed25519 signature, proving the signed bytes verify under a foreign crypto stack.

# The vector defaults to the one sitting beside this script, so the check runs from anywhere:
#   python3 conformance/cose-3rd-party/verify-with-foreign-stacks.py
# Pass a path to judge a different vector. The previous version hardcoded a bare filename, so it
# only worked when the working directory happened to be the repository root — and it accepted an
# argv path silently without using it, which is worse than rejecting one: you can hand it vector A,
# watch it verify vector B, and read that as a PASS for A.
