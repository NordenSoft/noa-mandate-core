# Golden backcompat vectors — frozen v0.3.0 output

**These files are FROZEN. Never regenerate them, never edit them by hand, never re-run a
generator against them.** They exist to answer one question forever: *does a receipt chain that
`noa-receipt@0.3.0` actually built and signed still verify with today's — and every future —
`verifyChain`/`verifyChainText`?*

This is a different guarantee than [`conformance/vectors/`](../../vectors), which IS regenerated on
every `npm test` run (from the *current* source, gated by `git status --porcelain` staying
clean in CI). That catches "the generator's output changed" for the in-development version. It
cannot catch "a change silently broke a receipt chain that a real `0.3.0` install already
produced and handed to a customer, years ago" — because it re-derives its own expected bytes
from the same code being tested. These golden vectors sidestep that: the bytes below were
produced ONCE by an actual `v0.3.0` checkout (`git tag v0.3.0`, built from that exact source,
not HEAD) and are asserted against verbatim, forever, by
[`test/golden-backcompat.test.ts`](../../../test/golden-backcompat.test.ts).

## Provenance

Generated from git tag `v0.3.0` — **commit `26cb18c8ded76e782dc41198b9cf7d12ca95ef05`** (the
exact SHA is recorded in [`MANIFEST.json`](MANIFEST.json) `commit`; verify with
`git rev-parse v0.3.0^{commit}`). The tag was checked out into an isolated worktree, built there
(`npm ci && npm run build`), and the generator script `scripts/gen-golden-vectors.mjs` was run
against **that** build's `dist/src/{builder,hash}.js` (see the script's header comment for the
exact invocation), NOT this repo's current `dist/`. The signing keys are fixed, hardcoded,
TEST-ONLY Ed25519 keypairs (`golden-signer-1`, `golden-signer-2`, `golden-signer-a`,
`golden-signer-b`) — their private keys are intentionally public in the generator script; never
reuse them for anything real.

This snapshot freezes **9 signed artifacts: 8 receipts** (1 genesis + 4 multi + 2 identity + 1
impersonation) **+ 1 signed checkpoint** — the counts are also machine-asserted in
`test/golden-backcompat.test.ts` against `MANIFEST.json`'s `receiptCount`/`checkpointCount`.

`scripts/gen-golden-vectors.mjs` is committed for reproducibility/audit (so anyone can re-derive
these exact bytes from the `v0.3.0` tag and diff), but it is **not** wired into `npm test` or any
CI step — running it is a conscious, manual, one-time action taken only when *adding a new
version's* golden snapshot (e.g. a future `conformance/golden/0.4.0/`), never to touch an
existing frozen directory.

## Scenarios

| Directory | Contents | Represents |
|---|---|---|
| `genesis/` | `chain.json` (1 receipt, seq 0 only), `keyring.json` | The minimal valid chain: a lone genesis receipt. |
| `multi/` | `chain.json` (4 receipts, 2 different signing agents), `keyring.json`, `checkpoint.json` | A realistic multi-agent chain spanning `DEFERRED`/`EXECUTED`/`BLOCKED` verdicts and `LOW`/`HIGH`/`CRITICAL` risk classes, plus a signed checkpoint over its head. |
| `identity/` | `chain.json` (2 agents, each signing with its own key), `keyring.json`, `manifest.json`, `impersonation-chain.json` | The `identityManifest` (agent.id → authorized kid) binding, plus a frozen cross-agent-impersonation attempt (`agent.id` claims one identity, signed by the *other* agent's key). |

See [`test/golden-backcompat.test.ts`](../../../test/golden-backcompat.test.ts) for the exact
scenario → options → expected-verdict table asserted against these files (VALID / UNVERIFIED /
TAMPERED / UNTRUSTED are all represented — a *security check that used to fire and stopped
firing* is exactly as much a backcompat break as a *valid chain that stopped verifying*). This
directory is unrelated to [`conformance/MATRIX.md`](../../MATRIX.md), the TS↔Python
cross-implementation pass/fail matrix.
