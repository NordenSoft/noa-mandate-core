# Contributing

Thanks for looking. This repository contains the open NOA Receipt protocol and its public
reference implementations. Contributions here are about the receipt format, verifiers, SDKs,
conformance artifacts, and generic integrations.

## The one hard rule: clean-room boundary

This repository accepts and emits **only generic action-provenance primitives** — enums,
opaque ids/handles, and hashes. Do **not** add:

- cognition / memory / planning / model-routing logic,
- tenant data, customer data, secrets, or real private keys,
- proprietary policy engines (a policy *decision* enters as a `verdict` enum, never the engine
  that produced it).

PRs that cross this line are declined on principle. See [THREAT-MODEL.md](./THREAT-MODEL.md).

Repository placement is itself a security boundary. A package-level `"private": true` flag only
prevents accidental publication to npm; it does **not** hide files committed to this public GitHub
repository. Hosted-control-plane code, production tenant configuration, customer-specific policy,
commercial risk intelligence, credentials, and operational data belong in the private product
repositories and must never be staged here. Before every release, inspect both `git diff --cached`
and `npm pack --dry-run --json` for boundary violations.

## Dev loop

```bash
npm install
npm test          # build + generate conformance vectors + run the suite (node:test)
npm run build     # type-check + emit dist/
npm run test:dogfood  # repository dogfood suite (vitest)
npm run verify -- conformance/vectors/valid-chain.json --keyring conformance/vectors/keyring.json
```

- **Node version:** the published package targets **Node ≥ 20** (`engines`) and has **zero runtime
  dependencies**, so consumers run it on any Node ≥ 20. The *contributor toolchain* is stricter: the
  dogfood suite's `vitest`/`vite` devDependency needs **Node ≥ 20.19** (or ≥ 22.12). This is a
  dev-only requirement — it does not narrow the runtime `engines` the package ships to consumers.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** is a feature — do not add one without a strong, discussed
  reason. Dev-only deps (TypeScript, types, vitest) are fine.
- If you touch hashing/canonicalization/schema, **regenerate vectors** (`npm run gen:vectors`)
  and commit them; CI fails on vector drift.
- New behavior needs a test. New attack ideas are especially welcome as conformance vectors.
