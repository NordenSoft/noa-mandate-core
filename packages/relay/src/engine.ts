/**
 * NOA Relay — the pure business core (see the public package README). The node:http layer (server.ts) is a
 * thin adapter over these methods; every rule is here so it is unit-testable without a socket.
 *
 * RELAY ≠ GATE — the load-bearing boundary this engine encodes:
 *   - The relay ROUTES gate-signed holds/envelopes + ciphertext and carries the approver-signed
 *     decision back. It has NO endpoint and NO method that mints a grant, a consumption, an
 *     uncertainty, or a timeout RECEIPT — those are all GATE-signed (spec §8) and never touch the
 *     relay. Grep this file: there is no `sign`, no private key, no receipt construction.
 *   - The relay owns the hold STATUS state machine (PENDING → APPROVED | DENIED | EXPIRED |
 *     CANCELLED_LOCAL_STATE_LOST). On timeout it sets status EXPIRED (reasonCode APPROVAL_TIMEOUT)
 *     — it does NOT build the BLOCKED timeout receipt (the gate's buildTimeoutReceipt does, §8).
 *   - EXPIRED is a DISTINCT terminal state, never an approval and never a human denial (Red
 *     Line 6). A decision arriving after EXPIRED is rejected fail-closed.
 *   - A phone Decision receipt is only ever STORED after its Ed25519 signature verifies against a
 *     registered device PUBLIC key (transport-level filter; authoritative trust is at the
 *     consumer). The relay never creates an ALLOWED receipt — so a compromised relay yields at
 *     worst DoS/spam, never a forged approval.

 * record: two routes, one hold, two different lifecycles, and a client that believes a decision
 * exists when the local state was lost and no decision was ever made. Small, real, and exactly the
 * defect shape a hand-copied invariant produces.

 * this repository consumes those events and they never reach an HTTP response — but the relay writing

    // bare `{action}` hold and a headless approver decides it with an UNCHAINED receipt

    // `:153` passes `null` as the previous receipt). Refusing those is an outage for that gate.
    //
    // Binding only WHEN a deferred receipt is present would be worse than useless: any bearer agent
    // can open a bare hold (`createHold` accepts one from any authenticated agent), so the adversary
    // simply omits the field and opts out of the guard. A check an attacker can decline is decoration.

  /**
   * BLIND TRANSPORT (owner decision, 2026-07-30). The relay does not publish a verdict.
   *
   * WHY, RESTED ON THE INVARIANT RATHER THAN ON A CONFIGURATION (rewritten 2026-08-04).
   *
   * This used to read "`POST /v1/devices` is open, so anyone who can reach the server registers an
   * approver key". That was true when it was written and is now STALE — R8-07 and ADR-0007 confined
   * that route to the loopback development opt-in, and a valid enrolment secret does not open it
   * (`server.ts:250-264`). Leaving the reason resting on an open route would have made this whole
   * provision look closed the day enrolment was tightened, which is exactly backwards.
   *
   * The durable reason is narrower and does not move: **enrolment authenticates a DEVICE to the
   * relay; it never authenticates an APPROVER to the tenant.** The relay holds no pinned root, so a
   * signature it accepts means "the enrolled device presenting this hold signed it" and can mean
   * nothing stronger. No real approval is forged — the gate re-verifies against its OWN
   * `receiptKeyring` before any grant and never reads relay state — but this view used to publish
   * `status: "APPROVED"` and `reasonCode: "HUMAN_APPROVED"`,
   * which is indistinguishable from a real approval to anyone who reads it and does not re-verify.
   * The docstring at the top of this file said "never a forged approval" while this method handed
   * one out. A document cannot carry that guarantee; the wire format has to.
   *
   * WHAT REPLACES IT. `lifecycle` reports only what the relay legitimately owns — whether a decision
   * has ARRIVED, not what it SAID. APPROVED and DENIED both collapse to `DECIDED`.
   *
   * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT — corrected 2026-07-30 after QA refuted the original wording. This is an
   * AUTHENTICITY change, NOT a confidentiality one. The relay stops asserting a verdict IN ITS OWN
   * VOICE; it does not hide the outcome. `decisionReceipt.governance.verdict` is published in this
   * same body in plaintext, and that is correct — the signed receipt is the payload the relay exists
   * to carry, and the relay cannot forge its signature. The earlier claim that the outcome was
   * "unlearnable without verifying" was simply false, and a false security claim in a docstring is
   * worse than the bug it describes.
   *
   * AND DO NOT VERIFY IT "AGAINST A REGISTERED KEY" — that phrasing was here and it is dangerous.
   * The relay's keyring is precisely the thing with no root: registration proves possession of a
   * keypair and nothing about the tenant, so "valid against a registered key" is satisfied BY THE
   * ATTACKER — with an enrolment credential, or without one wherever enrolment is open. Tightening
   * enrolment narrows WHO can register; it does not turn registration into authority. The sound check is the
   * CONSUMER'S OWN keyring, which is what the gate actually does — `gate/src/engine.ts` verifies with
   * `keyring: encodeDocument(this.trust.receiptKeyring)` and never consults relay state.
   *
   * EXPIRED survives, and the reason matters because the one first written here licenses the wrong
   * generalisation. "Not a human verdict, the relay owns it" is true and load-bearing for nothing:
   * the relay AUTHORS expiry unsigned from its own clock (`lazyExpire`), and to a consumer EXPIRED
   * and DENIED have the identical consequence — do not proceed. So EXPIRED *is* a relay-authored,
   * unsigned, actionable terminal state, the very shape this change removed elsewhere. It is right to
   * publish for a different reason: a compromised relay's power to FAIL an action is already total
   * and cannot be narrowed away by a wire format (it can drop the receipt, or simply not answer), so
   * EXPIRED grants no new capability, while removing it would break the timeout path the gate's
   * `buildTimeoutReceipt` and operators depend on.
   *
   * The internal state machine is UNCHANGED — `hold.status` still holds APPROVED/DENIED and is still
   * asserted directly against the store in tests. Only the PUBLISHED surface narrowed.

      // exactly such a path, in the same file, and I forgot it.
      //
      // MEASURED before this line existed: customer A's `wire.transfer` hold was pushed to an
      // unrelated customer B's device, carrying the hold UUID, the action canonical and the
      // approval deep link. Not a decision leak — a CONFIDENTIALITY leak, unsolicited, to every
      // enrolled device on the relay.
      //
      // It CALLS the shared guard rather than repeating the predicate, so this path cannot drift
      // from the four that already had it. Repeating `device.agentId !== hold.agentId` here would
      // have been the fifth copy of a rule, which is the shape this round keeps finding.
