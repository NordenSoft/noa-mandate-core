 *  · KID-BOUND (`kid`). The gate sees the phone key in the CONFIRMATION before it authors ACCEPTED,
 *    so the token can name the only device allowed to redeem it. A leaked paste bundle is then
 *    useless without that phone private key — a property a shared operator secret cannot have.
 *  · TENANT REQUIRED, never null. For AGENTS a null tenant fails CLOSED (it cannot publish a
 *    manifest). For DEVICES a null tenant fails OPEN: it bypasses the claim match at
 *    `engine.ts` and the device becomes claimable by anyone. The device namespace must not
 *    inherit the agent default, or this route reopens the race through the front door.
 *  · SINGLE-USE (`usedAt`), and "single-use" is the honest word. No revoke API exists for these
 *    tokens; single use plus a short TTL is the whole mechanism, and calling it "revocable" would be
