   * R-1 — operator-provisioned ENROLMENT SECRET for the three credential-minting routes

   *
   * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES: those routes sit above every auth block, so anyone who can reach the
   * server mints an agent key or registers an approver key. The relay's device keyring therefore has
   * no root — the trust it extends to a signature is "some key someone uploaded", not "an authorized
   * approver's key". Every other control in this package is downstream of that.
   *
   * THIS IS A DEPLOYMENT CREDENTIAL, NOT A CRYPTOGRAPHIC ROOT. It gates who may ENROL; it signs
   * nothing, verifies nothing, and introduces no new trusted party and no key custody. Rooting the
   * keyring itself (pinning a gate key) is a separate, one-way decision and is deliberately NOT this.
   *
   * DEFAULT `null`, AND ENROLMENT IS THEN CLOSED (revised 2026-07-31, R8-07):
   *   - no secret, no `allowAnonymousEnrolment` -> REFUSED (`503 ENROLMENT_NOT_CONFIGURED`),
   *     WHATEVER the bind address.
   *   - no secret, `allowAnonymousEnrolment: true` -> open. Development only, requested explicitly.
   *   - secret set -> required on all three routes, whatever the bind address.
   *
   * ⚠ WHAT THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO SAY, and why it is gone: it tied the default to the BIND ADDRESS
   * — "bound to LOOPBACK with no secret -> enrolment is OPEN. Nothing outside the machine can reach
   * it." That inference was false in the standard production shape (a loopback bind behind an
   * undeclared proxy) and was measured minting approver keys anonymously through one. Reachability
   * is not knowable from inside the process; this file said so two paragraphs down while the
   * default relied on knowing it anyway.

  /**
   * EXPLICIT, DEVELOPMENT-ONLY opt-in to mint credentials with no enrolment secret. Default `false`.
   *
   * ── R8-07 (2026-07-31): THE DEFAULT WAS THE VULNERABILITY ────────────────────────────────────
   * `enrolmentRefusal` used to permit anonymous enrolment whenever the bind was loopback and the
   * operator had declared neither `tlsTerminated` nor `unsafeListen`. Its own comment argued the
   * case: on a genuinely unreachable dev box a secret protects nothing.
   *
   * The premise is the problem. "Unreachable" was inferred from two booleans the OPERATOR has to
   * remember to set, and the standard production shape defeats it — a relay bound correctly to
   * loopback with an undeclared reverse proxy or tunnel in front. Measured by two independent
   * reviewers on the frozen tree:
   *
   *     POST /v1/pairings -> 201     POST /v1/pair -> 200 apiKey     POST /v1/devices -> 201
   *
   * with no credential at all, through a `0.0.0.0` proxy, while `bindAddress` still read
   * "127.0.0.1". That is anonymous minting of APPROVER keys, remotely, at shipped defaults.
   *
   * The relay was also the only component still arguing this direction. The gate settled the same
   * question against itself in `gate/src/engine.ts:305-306` under owner decision B-1: *"a default is
   * a security decision … otherwise the default is the vulnerability."* Two components applied
   * opposite defaults to the same class, and the credential-minting one had the permissive default.
   *
   * So the inference is gone. Enrolment now requires EITHER an operator-provisioned secret OR this
   * flag, set deliberately. Nothing is inferred from a bind address, because reachability is not
   * knowable from inside the process and this file already says so.
