/**
 * noa-relay — the NOA approval Relay (untrusted transport).
 *
 * RELAY ≠ GATE. This package routes gate-signed holds + encrypted-display ciphertext to the
 * approver client and carries the approver-signed decision back. It NEVER signs and NEVER holds a
 * private key (Red Line 3 / invariant 2). Grants, consumption, uncertainty and the timeout
 * RECEIPT are all GATE-signed (spec §8) and are intentionally absent from this surface.
