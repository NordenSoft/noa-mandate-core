/**
 * NOA Relay — VERIFY-ONLY crypto surface.
 *
 * RED LINE 3 / invariant 2 (see the package README's relay/gate boundary): the relay NEVER signs and NEVER holds a
 * private key. This module is the ONLY crypto in the relay, and it deliberately imports ZERO
 * signing capability:
 *   - it imports `ed25519.verify` (public-key verification), never `ed25519.sign`;
 *   - it reuses the EXACT receipt signing preimage from `noa-signer` (`receiptHashInput` +
 *     `signingMessageBytes(RECEIPT_SIG_DOMAIN, ...)`) so the relay's transport-level check is
 *     byte-consistent with what the phone signed and what `noa-receipt`/`verifyChain` would
 *     check — but it can only ever ANSWER "is this signature valid for this public key?", never
 *     PRODUCE a signature.
 *
 * A relay that could mint an ALLOWED receipt would make the core claim ("the signing key is
 * generated on the approver's device, never leaves it, never reaches our servers") false. There
 * is intentionally no code path here — or anywhere in this package — that takes a private key.

/**
 * R-ING-01 — ONE accessor-free snapshot of a caller-supplied document.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, measured on this tree: `engine.decide()` read
 * `receipt.governance.verdict` at one line and the signature check re-read the same property a few
 * lines later (through `noa-signer`'s `receiptHashInput`, which uses `structuredClone` and therefore
 * INVOKES accessors). A getter answering `ALLOWED` on the first read and `BLOCKED` on the second
 * made the relay record `APPROVED` / `HUMAN_APPROVED` while the signature that verified covered a
 * genuine human DENIAL. Same split reached the action binding and the stored receipt.
 *
 * Canonicalizing and re-parsing collapses the document to plain data ONCE, so every later read
 * necessarily returns the same value — there is no second answer left to give. It also removes the
 * accessor before the record is persisted, which is why the store can no longer invoke one either.
 *
 * Reuse first — this adds no dependency: `canonicalize` is already imported above for the signature
 * preimage. Fail-closed in the shape of `safeRefHash`: RFC 8785 rejects floats, non-finite numbers
 * and `undefined`, and a throwing getter throws here rather than deeper in.
 *
 * NOT a validity check. It answers "is this plain, canonicalizable data?" and nothing else; the
 * shape, the signature and the action binding are all still checked downstream.
