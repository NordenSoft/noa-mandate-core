/**
 * NOA Relay — persistent, zero-new-dependency `Store` implementation (#63-S3 / D5).
 *
 * `FileStore` implements the SAME `Store` interface (store.ts) as `InMemoryStore`, with the SAME
 * behavioral semantics. Manifest equivocation is enforced in BOTH the engine and this Store
 * boundary, so a direct caller or future compare/write race cannot replace an authoritative
 * equal-version record. It is backed by a single JSON snapshot file, using ONLY `node:fs` /
 * `node:path` / `node:crypto` — no new npm dependency.
 *
 * Durability model — HARDENED per the #63-S3 QA-panel findings (D1/D2/D3/D4/D5/D6 below; the
 * class-level doc previously overstated the guarantees here, corrected in place, not superseded
 * elsewhere):
 *   - **No false-ack on write failure (D1).** Every mutating call ends by attempting `persist()`.
 *     If that write fails for ANY reason (disk full, permission revoked mid-run, etc.), the error
 *     is NEVER swallowed: it propagates (throws) out of the `putX` call, and the in-memory Map
 *     mutation that was already applied is ROLLED BACK to its pre-call value first. Memory and
 *     disk are therefore never left inconsistent after a single failed mutation — the caller
 *     (engine → HTTP layer) sees the write FAIL, never a false 200/201/204 for data that never
 *     reached disk.
 *   - **No self-wipe on a real read error (D2).** On construction, `load()` reads the existing
 *     snapshot (if any). A MISSING file (`ENOENT`) or a genuinely EMPTY (0-byte) file both degrade
 *     to "start clean" — there is no data to lose either way. Anything else — permission denied,
 *     the path being a directory, disk I/O errors, or the bytes present not being valid JSON / not
 *     matching the expected shape — is a REAL error on a file that DOES exist and FAILS LOUD:
 *     the constructor throws and refuses to start. This is deliberate: silently starting empty
 *     over an unreadable/corrupt-but-existing file would let the very next `persist()` overwrite
 *     it with an empty-derived snapshot, permanently destroying whatever was really in it.
 *   - **Malformed array elements never crash the process (D3).** `normalizeSnapshot()` validates
 *     each element of every known array field (the minimal shape this class indexes by — `.id`,
 *     `.kid`, `.deviceId`, `.token`, `.agentId`/`.idempotencyKey`, `.tenant`) before it is ever
 *     used as a Map key. A malformed element (`null`, a bare number, `{}`) is REJECTED — per the
 *     same D2 fail-loud policy, this throws rather than silently dropping the bad element and
 *     continuing with only the "valid-looking" neighbors (which would hide a real corruption event
 *     behind a clean-looking partial snapshot).
 *   - **0600 file permissions (D4).** The snapshot holds credential HASHES, push handles, receipts
 *     and decision artifacts. Both the temp file and the final file (rename preserves the temp
 *     file's mode) are created owner-only (`0o600`), independent of the process umask.
 *   - **fsync durability, scoped honestly (D5).** The temp file's CONTENTS are `fsync`ed before the
 *     atomic rename, so the bytes that become the new file are on stable storage — not just the OS
 *     page cache — before they go live at `this.filePath`. The containing directory is ALSO
 *     best-effort `fsync`ed after the rename (flushing the rename's directory-entry update); that
 *     second fsync is POSIX-specific, not universally supported, and therefore best-effort/
 *     swallowed on failure. The guarantee this class actually makes is scoped to exactly those two
 *     fsync calls — NOT "immune to every possible power-loss ordering on every filesystem."
 *   - **Single-process guard (D6).** The constructor takes an exclusive lock (`<path>.lock`, created
 *     via `wx` so a SECOND process attempting the same path fails closed immediately with a clear
 *     error) and releases it via `close()` on clean shutdown (wired into `server.ts`'s `close()` via
 *     the optional `Store.close?()` hook). **`FileStore` is single-process-only** — two processes
 *     sharing a path is a last-writer-wins hazard the lock now prevents entirely rather than
 *     silently allowing; true multi-instance/HA needs a real database behind the `Store` interface,
 *     not this class. (Known residual: if a process holding the lock is SIGKILLed, the `.lock` file
 *     is not auto-removed — an operator must delete the stale lock file before restarting; no
 *     PID-liveness staleness detection is implemented, to avoid the cross-platform TOCTOU/PID-reuse
 *     edge cases that would come with it.)
 *   - `Store` methods are synchronous by interface contract, and Node is single-threaded with no
 *     `await` point inside a `putX` call — so two "rapid" mutations from THIS process can never
 *     interleave their writes; `persist()` of mutation N always fully completes (or throws and
 *     rolls back) before mutation N+1's JS even starts running.
 *
 * KNOWN, BOUNDED-SCOPE RESIDUAL (documented, not solved here — #63-S3 QA-panel item (a)): several
 * engine operations perform TWO separate `Store` mutations for one logical action (e.g.
 * `engine.ts` `redeemPairing()`: `putAgent()` then `putPairing()` to consume the token). Each
 * individual `Store` call is now atomic + fsynced (D1/D5) on its OWN, but the PAIR is not — a crash
 * between the two persisted writes leaves an orphan agent whose pairing token is still
 * `usedAt: null` (still redeemable again after restart). Closing this needs a batched/transactional
 * multi-write primitive added to the `Store` interface itself (affecting every implementer,
 * including `InMemoryStore`, and the `engine.ts` call sites) — out of this hardening pass's
 * additive, single-file scope; tracked as a follow-up.
 *
 * NOTE (same invariant as InMemoryStore, store.ts:10): no method here accepts or returns a private
 * key. Only public keys + secret HASHES ever pass through this class, because that is all the
 * `Store` interface's record types (types.ts) carry.
