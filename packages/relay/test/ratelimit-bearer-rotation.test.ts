/**
 * R8-13 — PERMANENT REGRESSION. A rate limiter whose key the attacker chooses is not a limiter.
 *
 * MEASURED BEFORE THE FIX (round 8, cross-family, independently reproduced by two reviewers):
 * `server.ts` computed `bearer ? \`k:${bearer.secret}\` : \`ip:${addr}\`` — the bucket key was the
 * caller's OWN token string, read off the wire BEFORE any credential resolution. So:
 *
 *   400 requests, 400 distinct INVALID bearers  ->  400x 401,  ZERO 429
 *   40  requests, ONE bearer                    ->  30x 429
 *   POST /v1/devices, 200 rotating bearers      ->  200 device credentials minted, ZERO 429
 *
 * Rotating a header bought a fresh allowance, from an unauthenticated stranger, on the
 * credential-MINTING routes. And nothing evicted: `grep -cE '\.delete\(|\.clear\('` over
 * `ratelimit.ts` returned 0, so every invented string was retained for the process lifetime — an
 * unbounded Map an anonymous caller could grow at will.
 *
 * The fix is not a tighter number. It is that the PEER ADDRESS is spent first and unconditionally,
 * so the only quantity the untrusted side controls can no longer select the bucket.
