/**
 * E-3 — PERMANENT REGRESSION. Authenticating an agent is not authorizing it.
 *
 * MEASURED BEFORE THE FIX, on this tree at a24618e: a second legitimately-registered agent called
 * `getHold(victimHoldId)` and received `200` carrying the victim's `status: APPROVED`,
 * `reasonCode: HUMAN_APPROVED`, `action.canonical: wire.transfer`, and the victim's approver-signed
 * `decisionReceipt` including its Ed25519 signature. `/wait` answered `200` on the same id.
 *
 * With more than one customer on one relay, that is one customer reading another customer's
 * approvals and harvesting the human signatures that authorized them.
 *
 * Named after and ported from the gate's `cross-agent-authz.test.ts`, because the gate had the same
 * gap (F29-authz) and had already closed it. The relay simply never got the port.

 *
 * `ownsHold` closed the AGENT read paths and nothing closed the DEVICE paths. Measured before the
 * fix: customer B's freshly enrolled device called `listPending()` and received customer A's hold
 * with its canonical action, riskClass and paramsHash; then posted its OWN honestly-signed ALLOWED
 * on A's hold and drove it to APPROVED / HUMAN_APPROVED, signed by kid `customer-B-approver`.
 *
 * No forgery and no stolen credential. B simply approved someone else's action, because
 * `listPending()` took no caller at all and `decide()` took a device without ever asking whether it
 * was allowed to act on THAT hold — it checked only that the presenter signed the receipt, which is
 * true of an attacker signing honestly with its own key.
