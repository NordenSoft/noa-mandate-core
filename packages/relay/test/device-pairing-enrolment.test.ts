/**
 * An approver client joins by redeeming a token issued through the pairing ceremony. The token is:
 *
 *   · KID-BOUND, so a leaked bundle is useless without the approver's private key;
 *   · TENANT-CARRYING, so the enrolled device is claimable only by its own tenant;
 *   · SINGLE-USE and short-lived — the honest words, since no revoke API exists for these tokens;
 *   · HASHED AT REST, unlike the agent pairing token beside it.
 *
 * Refusing a re-redeem is right, but it must not BRICK THE KID. A phone that lost the response holds
 * a secret it cannot prove and cannot revoke — `revokeSelf` needs that very secret. So recovery
 * exists: a FRESH token for the same kid re-mints onto the EXISTING device, same id, claim state
 * preserved. Copying the anonymous route's unconditional `409 KID_ALREADY_REGISTERED` here would
 * make a lost response permanent.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY TEST BELOW BUT TWO IS A REFUSAL. A route that refused everything would pass all of them,
 * which is why the controls come first and why the recovery test asserts a working secret rather
 * than merely a 2xx.
