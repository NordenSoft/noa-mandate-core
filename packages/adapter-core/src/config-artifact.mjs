/**
 * config-artifact.mjs — the ONE hardened open/read/append/write path for a SECURITY-BEARING
 * CONFIG FILE: an artifact whose CONTENT decides whether a human has to approve an action, and
 * whose signature is allowed to stand in for that human.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS MODULE EXISTS TO CLOSE (reproduced 2026-08-12, not theoretical) ────────────────
 * `packages/mcp-proxy/src/proxy.mjs` read `--approval-rules`, `--approver-keyring` and
 * `--approver-identity` with a path-based `readFileSync(path, "utf8")`, and
 * `packages/adapter-core/src/pending-store.mjs` read/appended `--pending-store` the same way. A
 * path-based read FOLLOWS A SYMLINK. Two attacks were measured against the shipped CLI:
 *
 *   1. Replace `approval-rules.json` with a symlink to a file containing `[]`. The human-approval
 *      gate is then OFF, and a `transfer_funds` of 7000 minor units — well above the configured
 *      5000 threshold — was FORWARDED AND EXECUTED with no human approval at any point. The
 *      downstream answered "transferred 7000 (minor units) to attacker-account".
 *   2. Replace `approver-keyring.json` with a symlink to an attacker-controlled keyring. The
 *      attacker then signs the approval with their OWN key, and the identical retry EXECUTED.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS IN SCOPE AND NOT AN OPERATOR PROBLEM. This product exists to stop an AI agent from
 * taking a consequential action without a named human's approval. In most real deployments the
 * agent process CAN WRITE ITS OWN WORKING DIRECTORY. So "the attacker can create a file in the
 * config directory" is not an exotic precondition — it is the ordinary state of the thing being
 * constrained. An enforcement boundary that a file swap turns off is not a boundary.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE DOES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every access goes through ONE descriptor that cannot be redirected by a later path swap:
 *
 *   - `openSync(path, ... | O_NOFOLLOW)` — the open ITSELF fails (ELOOP) when the final path
 *     component is a symlink, whether it resolves or dangles. There is no separate "check the
 *     path, then open the path" gap for a race to land in, because the check IS the open.
 *   - `fstatSync(fd)` — on the DESCRIPTOR, never a second `statSync` on the PATH (which would
 *     reopen the very TOCTOU window this closes). It must be a REGULAR FILE: a FIFO, a device or a
 *     directory can hand a different answer to every read, which is the same bug with a longer fuse.
 *   - OWNER: the file must belong to this process's effective uid, or to root. A file planted by a
 *     DIFFERENT uid never becomes a verdict here.
 *   - MODE: group/other WRITE bits are refused. A world-writable rule set is not a rule set.
 *   - The bytes are then read from THAT SAME DESCRIPTOR — the path is never re-opened.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO, STATED PLAINLY ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does NOT defend against an attacker who can rewrite the file's CONTENT IN PLACE as the same
 * uid. Same-uid in-place content rewriting is indistinguishable, at the filesystem layer, from the
 * operator editing their own config, and no `open` flag can tell those apart. It does NOT defend
 * against an attacker who controls this process (they need no file at all), nor against one who
 * owns the directory AND runs as the trusted uid. Defending the CONTENT needs the content to be
 * signed and the signature checked against a key that does not live beside it — see
 * NON-CLAIMS.md NC-6.9. What is closed here is the REDIRECTION class: the path the operator
 * configured no longer decides which BYTES the process reads.

 * VERIFY the existing artifact through a descriptor → write the replacement to a SIBLING temp file
 * (`O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`) → `fsync` → atomic `rename` over the target.
 *
 * Round 1 fixed the destructive half of this: the open no longer carries `O_TRUNC`, so a REFUSED
 * write leaves its target byte-for-byte unchanged (it used to empty the file inside the `open`, then
 * refuse). But an ACCEPTED write was still destructive and non-atomic — `ftruncate` emptied the
 * artifact before the replacement was durable, so an ENOSPC, a crash or a short write left the
 * approver keyring EMPTY or half-written, and a hard link created AFTER the `nlink` check still
 * aliased the verified inode. Writing a new inode and swapping the directory entry removes both: the
 * target is either entirely the old content or entirely the new one, this process never writes into
 * an inode a second name can be attached to, and a symlink planted in the window is REPLACED rather
 * than written through (`rename` acts on the entry, never on what it points at).
 *
 * The residual, stated rather than implied: `rename` replaces whatever the path holds at that
 * instant, so the verification and the swap are not one atomic step. What that window can cost is
 * "this process published its own artifact over something that appeared in between" — never "this
 * process wrote through a link into a file it never verified", which is the class that mattered.
