// this package in two days, every one of them a LIVE builtin read that an attacker could replace
// after module load: an approval seat bound by `Array.prototype.includes`, a signature verified over
// bytes from `Buffer.concat`, a policy weakening hidden by `JSON.stringify`, an approval rule made
// invisible by `Array.isArray`. Auditing the remaining ~300 flagged reads one at a time is not a
// control — it is a race against the next person who adds one.
//
// So the builtins are taken from the kernel's module-load capture here too, whether or not each
// individual site is reachable today. Reachability is a property of the surrounding code, and the
// surrounding code changes.
// `objectSetPrototypeOf` closes the WRITE half of the same argument (L11): every per-session state
// object below is mutated with `state.prev = …` / `state.seq += 1`, which are [[Set]] operations
// that walk the receiver's prototype chain. An accessor at `Object.prototype.seq` swallows the
// sequence increment while the commit still reports success — a receipt chain that stops advancing
// with no builtin replaced at all. The two state literals are null-rooted at construction.

/**
 * Per-session receipt-chain state for preCheck().
 *
 * A single proxy/gateway process may serve MORE THAN ONE concurrent MCP session (e.g. an
 * HTTP-fronted gateway multiplexing several host connections against one downstream, or — as in
 * this package's own smoke test — two independent sessions exercised in one process). Each
 * session's receipt chain must be independent: session A's `prev`/`seq` must never leak into
 * session B's chain. A single global `{ prev, seq }` (or a single global array) would silently
 * interleave two sessions' chains into one — this is the bug this module exists to make
 * structurally impossible.
 *
 * `createChainSessionStore()` owns exactly one thing: `Map<sessionId, { prev, seq, lastAccessedAt,
 * segmentId }>`. It does NOT keep a receipt log/history — that is a separate, deployment-specific
 * concern (persistence, audit export, `verifyChain` replay) layered on top by the caller, exactly as
 * examples/mcp-preflight/preflight.mjs's own `main()` keeps its `chain` array outside `preCheck`.
 *
 * `advance()` only ever moves a session's `{prev, seq}` FORWARD, never back — a caller that needs
 * "compute a receipt, persist it, then commit" (so a persist failure never burns a seq slot) must
 * NOT call `advance()`/`preCheckSession()` before persistence succeeds. Use `prepareSessionReceipt()`
 * + `commitSessionReceipt()` (below) instead; see `packages/mcp-proxy`'s create-proxy-server.mjs.
 *
 * Bounded-lifetime by construction — a caller that never explicitly calls `end()` (e.g. a host that
 * disconnects without a clean close, or simply forgets to) cannot grow this store forever:
 *   - idle-TTL: a session untouched for `idleTtlMs` is dropped by `sweep()` (run automatically on
 *     `sweepIntervalMs`, and callable directly for deterministic tests).
 *   - max-sessions cap: creating a session past `maxSessions` evicts the single oldest-idle session
 *     first (never silently exceeds the cap).
 * Both paths call `onEvict(sessionId, reason)` (default: a stderr warning) so an operator can see it.
 *
 * SEGMENT IDENTITY (eviction/reconnect ≠ chain corruption): idle-TTL eviction, cap eviction, and a
 * clean `end()` all drop a session's `{prev, seq}` bookkeeping — but a LATER `stateFor()` call on
 * the exact same `sessionId` (the host resumed, or simply reconnected) must NEVER silently reuse the
 * same default chain identity at a fresh `seq=0`: a persisted receipt log spanning both the
 * pre-reincarnation and post-reincarnation receipts would then carry two receipts claiming the same
 * `scope.chain` + `seq=0`, and `verifyChain()` correctly (and unhelpfully) reports that as TAMPERED
 * ("duplicate seq 0") — the log is not actually tampered, the store just handed out a colliding
 * chain identity.
 *
 * The store used to derive this uniqueness from a sessionId-scoped "tombstone" (an eviction-only,
 * `sessionId`-keyed epoch counter) folded into the chain-id as a `#<epoch>` string suffix. That
 * scheme had two independent, exploitable holes: (1) a clean `end()` never refreshed/cleared the
 * tombstone, so `evict → resume(epoch N) → end() → reconnect` handed the RECONNECT the exact same
 * `#N` suffix the still-live resumed segment was already using — a real collision, not merely a
 * theoretical one; and (2) because the epoch suffix was string-concatenated onto whatever the caller
 * passed as `sessionId`, a sessionId that itself CONTAINS the delimiter (e.g. the literal session id
 * `"foo#2"`) could collide with an unrelated, internally-epoch-suffixed `"foo"` at epoch 2 — the
 * uniqueness property depended on parsing/matching sessionId text, which a caller's own sessionId
 * choice could always defeat.
 *
 * The fix replaces BOTH: chain identity is no longer derived from parsing sessionId text or from a
 * per-sessionId epoch at all. Instead, every single time `stateFor()` mints a BRAND-NEW state object
 * for a `sessionId` — first-ever creation, or any reincarnation after `end()`/idle-TTL/cap eviction,
 * with NO exception — it draws the next value from `segmentCounter`, a single integer scoped to this
 * store instance that only ever increases, is assigned to exactly one state object, and is NEVER
 * reused or decremented for the lifetime of the store. The default chain-id (built in
 * `prepareSessionReceipt` below) is `${tenant}:${sessionId}#seg${segmentId}`. Because `segmentId` is
 * unique across EVERY reincarnation of EVERY sessionId this store instance has ever created — not
 * just across reincarnations of the same id — two different segments can never be handed the same
 * chain-id regardless of what either caller's `sessionId` string contains (no string-parsing
 * ambiguity is possible: the counter, not the text, carries the uniqueness). An operator/verifier who
 * persists ALL receipts for a long-lived, occasionally-reincarnated sessionId into one log must
 * therefore GROUP BY `scope.chain` before calling `verifyChain()` (each group is its own honestly-
 * independent, fully-verifiable segment) — exactly the same discipline a multi-session log already
 * requires today, since two DIFFERENT sessionIds already get two different `scope.chain` ids.
 *
 * CROSS-PROCESS-RESTART SEGMENT IDENTITY: `segmentCounter` above is memory-only, scoped to ONE
 * `createChainSessionStore()` call — a fresh process (e.g. `packages/mcp-proxy`'s CLI restarted
 * against a persisted `--key-file`, which keeps the SAME signing `kid` and can be launched with the
 * SAME operator-supplied `--session-id` across the restart) constructs a BRAND-NEW store whose
 * `segmentCounter` independently starts at 0 again. Without anything further, that fresh process's
 * very first segment for that stable sessionId would ALSO be `segmentId = 1` — identical to the
 * pre-restart process's first segment — so the default chain-id
 * (`${tenant}:${sessionId}#seg${segmentId}`) would collide across the restart even though neither
 * segment is actually tampered with (the exact same class of fabricated-TAMPERED-via-colliding-
 * chain-id bug the segment-counter redesign above fixed for WITHIN one process). The fix: every
 * `createChainSessionStore()` call additionally mints a store-instance-scoped `instanceToken`
 * (`randomUUID()`, once, at construction) and folds it into the default chain-id BEFORE the
 * `segmentId` suffix — `${tenant}:${sessionId}#${instanceToken}-seg${segmentId}` (see
 * `prepareSessionReceipt` below) — so two DIFFERENT store instances (i.e. two DIFFERENT process
 * lifetimes) can never mint the same default chain-id for the same sessionId, no matter how their
 * independent `segmentCounter`s happen to line up. `instanceToken` is placed BEFORE `seg${segmentId}`
 * (not after) so `segmentId` stays the chain-id's trailing digit run — the same sessionId-mimicry
 * collision-resistance property already proven above (uniqueness comes from the counter/token pair,
 * never from parsing the chain-id string) is unaffected by ordering; this convention is simply about
 * keeping a human/operator reading a chain-id able to spot "segment N" at a glance. Exposed via the
 * returned store's `instanceToken` getter, mainly for diagnostics/tests.
 *
 * Honest limit: this closes the COLLISION, not persistence. A restarted process's first segment for
 * a stable sessionId is a legitimately NEW, distinct chain segment — it does NOT continue the
 * pre-restart segment's seq. True cross-restart continuity of ONE logical chain would require
 * persisting `segmentCounter`/`{prev,seq}` state itself (not just the signing key), which this store
 * does not do — see `packages/mcp-proxy/README.md`'s "Honest limits" section.
 *
 * COMMIT-TIME SEGMENT CHECK: `advance()` (below) is the write half of the prepare→persist→commit
 * split (see `prepareSessionReceipt`/`commitSessionReceipt`). Because persistence can be genuinely
 * asynchronous, an unrelated event — a clean `end()` (e.g. `server.onclose` firing for an abrupt
 * host-side disconnect), an idle-TTL sweep, or a cap eviction — can race in during the gap between
 * "prepare" and "commit" for the SAME sessionId. If `advance()` unconditionally resurrected a
 * missing session (as it used to), it would auto-vivify a BRAND-NEW segment and graft the
 * already-stale-by-then receipt onto it as that fresh segment's `prev` — corrupting the NEW
 * segment's seq (it would start at 1, with a `prevHash` pointing at a receipt from a DIFFERENT
 * `scope.chain`, so the very next `verifyChain()` on that new segment's own receipts reports a
 * fabricated "gap"/TAMPERED for a segment that was never actually tampered with). The fix: `advance()`
 * accepts the `segmentId` the receipt was PREPARED against (see `prepareSessionReceipt`) and is a
 * NO-OP — it does not resurrect, does not graft, does not advance `seq` — unless the session's LIVE
 * state still exists AND is still that SAME segment. A caller (`packages/mcp-proxy`'s
 * `create-proxy-server.mjs`) that additionally routes any `store.end()` call through the same
 * per-session serialization queue used for prepare→persist→commit closes the race window entirely
 * (the end() can then only run before an in-flight call starts, or after it has fully settled) —
 * `advance()`'s segment check is the second, independent layer that also protects a caller which
 * does NOT (or cannot) queue its `end()` calls that way.
 *
 * MULTI-TENANT ISOLATION: a single proxy/gateway process can serve MORE THAN ONE tenant (the
 * `tenant` option every tenant-aware entry point below accepts) — e.g. a multi-tenant SaaS gateway
 * fronting many customers' MCP sessions through one process. Two DIFFERENT tenants can legitimately
 * hand this store the exact SAME `sessionId` string (sessionIds are not guaranteed globally unique
 * across tenants — a tenant has no reason to know, or coordinate on, another tenant's session-id
 * scheme). Before this store became tenant-aware, its ONE session Map was keyed by `sessionId`
 * alone — `tenant` only ever affected the CHAIN-ID a receipt records (`scope.chain`), never which
 * `{prev, seq, segmentId}` bucket a call actually read/wrote. Two tenants sharing a sessionId would
 * therefore silently SHARE one live state object: tenant B's very first call could inherit tenant
 * A's `{prev, seq}` chain position outright (tenant B's receipt would even claim `seq > 0` on what
 * tenant B believes is its first-ever call) — a genuine cross-tenant chain-state leak, not merely a
 * cosmetic chain-id collision.
 *
 * Fixed by keying this store TWO LEVELS deep — `Map<tenant, Map<sessionId, state>>` — rather than
 * concatenating `tenant` and `sessionId` into one string key. A single concatenated string key
 * (e.g. `` `${tenant}:${sessionId}` ``) would reopen the EXACT class of collision this module's own
 * "SEGMENT IDENTITY" section above already fixed once for chain-ids: a tenant `"a"` with sessionId
 * `"b:c"` and a tenant `"a:b"` with sessionId `"c"` would both concatenate to the identical string
 * `"a:b:c"`, with no way for the store to tell them apart after the fact. Nesting two nested Maps
 * (rather than one string-keyed Map) makes that ambiguity structurally impossible — `tenant` and
 * `sessionId` are compared as independent values, never joined into a shared string, so no content
 * either one contains can ever be crafted to collide with the other. Every tenant-aware entry point
 * (`peek`/`advance`/`end`) defaults its `tenant` parameter to `DEFAULT_TENANT` ("default-tenant" —
 * the same literal `preCheck()` itself defaults to) when omitted, so a caller that never passes
 * `tenant` at all — every pre-existing single-tenant caller — sees IDENTICAL behavior to before
 * this store became tenant-aware.

   *  per-entry recency field (no wall-clock timestamp; `lastAccessedAt` below is set to the SAME
   *  `now()` for every kept seed), so when `seedSessions.length > maxSessions` this keeps only the
   *  LAST `maxSessions` entries of the array as given (in array order) and drops the rest — a caller
   *  with a genuine oldest-first ordering keeps its most-recently-active sessions this way, and even
   *  a caller with no such ordering (e.g. an arbitrary directory-traversal order) still gets a store
   *  that never exceeds its own cap, exactly the invariant `stateFor()`'s own eviction-on-create path
   *  already upholds for every session minted AFTER construction. A dropped seed is NOT silently
   *  lost: it is logged loudly (see below) and simply starts a brand-new segment the next time that
   *  `(tenant, sessionId)` is seen — the same outcome any other eviction produces. (`createFileSessionStore`'s
   *  own `reloadAll()` is exactly the "genuine oldest-first ordering" caller this promise depends on —
   *  WITHIN a single tenant's own file: each tenant's `live` Map is built by deleting then re-setting
   *  each sessionId's entry on every touch, so that tenant's OWN sessions land in `seedSessions` in
   *  LAST-touch order, not first-appearance. For a single-tenant caller -- or whenever every tenant's
   *  sessions together fit under `maxSessions`, so nothing here gets truncated at all -- this
   *  array-order truncation does keep the most-recently-active sessions on a scale-down restart.
   *
   *  HONEST LIMIT -- CROSS-TENANT ORDERING: `reloadAll()`'s outer loop visits tenant files in
   *  `readdirSync(dir)` order (filesystem/directory-enumeration order over
   *  `tenant-<sha256(tenant)>.jsonl` filenames) -- NOT any cross-tenant recency signal; a session's
   *  actual last-touch position is only ever compared against OTHER sessions in the SAME tenant's
   *  file, never across tenants. `seedSessions` is therefore [tenant A's sessions, last-touch order]
   *  concatenated with [tenant B's sessions, last-touch order] concatenated with ..., in whatever
   *  order `readdirSync` happens to enumerate the tenant files. When MORE THAN ONE tenant is present
   *  and their combined session count exceeds `maxSessions`, the `.slice(-maxSessions)` truncation
   *  above keeps whichever TENANTS happen to sort last in that enumeration order -- not the tenants
   *  (or sessions) that were actually most recently active. A tenant whose sessions are genuinely
   *  stale can therefore survive a scale-down restart while a different tenant's genuinely fresher
   *  session is dropped wholesale, purely as a function of directory-enumeration order. The cap
   *  invariant itself is never violated (this store instance never ends up holding more than
   *  `maxSessions` live sessions after seeding, exactly as documented above) -- only the CHOICE of
   *  which sessions survive stops being true cross-tenant recency once more than one tenant shares
   *  the cap. A dropped seed is still handled exactly like any other eviction (see above): logged,
   *  and it simply starts a brand-new segment the next time that `(tenant, sessionId)` is seen.
   *  Closing this fully would require `reloadAll()` to track each session's actual last-touch
   *  position globally and sort `seedSessions` by it BEFORE truncation (a real cross-tenant merge)
   *  instead of concatenating per-tenant slices in directory-enumeration order -- out of scope for
   *  this store's current file-per-tenant layout; see `createFileSessionStore`'s own "HONEST LIMITS"
