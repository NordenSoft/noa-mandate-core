/**
 * createFileSessionStore(dir) — opt-in, file-backed session store: a drop-in replacement for
 * noa-mcp-adapter-core's createChainSessionStore (identical returned shape: peek/advance/end/
 * sweep/dispose/size/instanceToken) that ALSO survives a process restart with the chain staying
 * ONE continuous, verifiably-unbroken segment — instead of createChainSessionStore's own
 * documented default (see its "CROSS-PROCESS-RESTART SEGMENT IDENTITY" section): every restart
 * mints a fresh instanceToken, so a restarted process's receipts always start a NEW segment.
 *
 * HOW: wraps an IN-MEMORY createChainSessionStore instance (reusing its eviction/TTL/multi-tenant/
 * segment-collision logic wholesale — this module duplicates none of that) and adds a durable
 * layer on top:
 *   - `<dir>/.instance.json` — this store's `instanceToken`, minted ONCE and reused on every later
 *     construction against the same `dir`, so a resumed session's default chain-id
 *     (`${tenant}:${sessionId}#${instanceToken}-seg${segmentId}`) is IDENTICAL across a restart.
 *   - `<dir>/tenant-<sha256(tenant)>.jsonl` — one append-only file per tenant. Each line is either
 *     `{kind:"receipt", tenant, sessionId, segmentId, receipt}` (one per commit) or
 *     `{kind:"end", tenant, sessionId}` (a tombstone written on a clean end() or an idle-TTL/
 *     cap eviction — a LATER stateFor() for that (tenant,sessionId) must mint a fresh segment,
 *     never resume the tombstoned one, exactly matching createChainSessionStore's own end()
 *     contract). The filename hashes `tenant` (never embeds it directly) so an arbitrary
 *     operator-supplied tenant string can never produce a path-unsafe or colliding filename; the
 *     plaintext `tenant` is instead carried inside every line for recovery/readability.
 *   - `<dir>/.lock` — a PID-tagged lockfile (O_EXCL create). A second construction against a dir
 *     whose lock-holder pid is verifiably still alive (`process.kill(pid, 0)`) refuses to start
 *     (two proxies must never write to the same session-dir concurrently — they'd race on the
 *     SAME tenant files with no coordination). A lock whose holder pid is verifiably DEAD (the
 *     realistic post-crash-restart case, since a crash never runs dispose()) is reclaimed
 *     automatically instead of requiring manual intervention.
 *
 * RELOAD / FAIL-CLOSED: at construction, EVERY existing tenant-*.jsonl file in `dir` is read and
 * replayed in full (kind:"receipt" sets the session's live state, kind:"end" clears it) to
 * rebuild `seedSessions` (live sessions to resume) and `segmentCounterFloor` (the highest
 * segmentId ever used, across BOTH live and ended sessions, so a brand-new segment minted after
 * this restart can never collide with one used before it). A line that fails to JSON.parse, or
 * doesn't match the expected shape, is treated as a torn write (a process killed mid
 * fs.appendFileSync) and REFUSES construction with a clear error — it does NOT truncate the bad
 * line and continue, since silently dropping unreadable state could just as easily be masking a
 * deeper corruption.
 *
 * COMMIT-TIME, MEMORY-FIRST (cross-review fix, found during this module's own review pass): `advance()` calls
 * the WRAPPED in-memory store's own `advance()` FIRST, and only writes the new JSONL line to
 * disk if THAT call actually succeeds (returns `true`). This module used to do the reverse
 * (write to disk, THEN call `inner.advance()`) — which looked like a reasonable mirror of the
 * compute -> persist -> commit discipline `packages/mcp-proxy`'s create-proxy-server.mjs applies
 * one layer up, but was actually a distinct, unrelated bug: `inner.advance()` (see
 * session-store.mjs's own "COMMIT-TIME SEGMENT CHECK" docstring) can legitimately return `false`
 * — DROP the commit as stale — when the session was torn down or moved to a newer segment
 * between `prepareSessionReceipt()` and this call. Writing to disk BEFORE that check meant a
 * receipt the LIVE chain never actually accepted could still land in the JSONL file as if it
 * had — and a later restart's `reloadAll()` would wrongly resume from that orphaned receipt,
 * corrupting the very continuity this module exists to provide. Because `inner.advance()` (when
 * given `expectedSegmentId`, which the real production path — `packages/mcp-proxy`'s
 * create-proxy-server.mjs — always does) is ITSELF a pure check-then-update with NO mutation on
 * its `false` path (a missing session or a segmentId mismatch returns `false` without touching
 * any state), calling it first costs nothing and closes this exactly: a commit `inner` would
 * drop as stale is now rejected BEFORE a single byte reaches disk.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED POISON (the residual failure mode once the ordering above is memory-first): once
 * `inner.advance()` has SUCCEEDED (the live chain has already accepted this receipt as its new
 * head), the disk write itself can still fail (ENOSPC, a lost filesystem, permission loss).
 * `createChainSessionStore` exposes no way to undo an in-memory `advance()` in place, so at that
 * point this store instance's disk state and its live in-memory state are PROVABLY diverged: any
 * FURTHER call would extend a chain in memory that a restart could never reconstruct identically
 * from disk. Rather than silently continuing on a store that can no longer make its core
 * durability property, this call POISONS the whole store instance — every subsequent
 * `advance()`/`peek()`/`end()`/`sweep()` call rejects until the process is restarted against
 * `dir` (a restart's own `reloadAll()` then either recovers cleanly from the last GOOD line on
 * disk, or — if the failed write left a torn/partial line behind — refuses to start with a clear
 * error, per this module's own "RELOAD / FAIL-CLOSED" section above, rather than silently
 * resuming from an unknown state). This call itself also throws (never returns `false` for a
 * disk-write failure — `false` is reserved for the ORDINARY "commit dropped as stale" case above,
 * which is not an error), so the immediate caller (`packages/mcp-proxy`'s create-proxy-server.mjs,
 * via `commitSessionReceipt`) sees this specific call fail closed too, exactly like any other
 * prepare/persist/commit failure it already handles.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITS:
 *   - `peek()` on a session that has NEVER been touched before mints a brand-new segmentId in the
 *     wrapped in-memory store EAGERLY, before any commit — this is pre-existing
 *     createChainSessionStore behavior, not something this module introduces. If the very FIRST
 *     call for a session fails before ever reaching `advance()` (e.g. its persist step throws), that
 *     minted segmentId is never written to disk and so is not reflected in `segmentCounterFloor` on
 *     the next restart. This is a narrow, accepted gap: it can only matter if a LATER, unrelated
 *     session's sessionId is independently crafted to collide with that exact unused segmentId AND
 *     tenant/instanceToken suffix — the same class of adversarial text-crafting
 *     createChainSessionStore's own SEGMENT IDENTITY design already defeats for every OTHER case.
 *   - This module installs no process signal handlers. `dispose()` releases `.lock` on a clean
 *     shutdown; a crash leaves it behind, and the next construction against the same `dir` reclaims
 *     it automatically via the dead-pid check above — by design, not an oversight.
 *   - Corruption/lock recovery uses `readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` synchronously (matching this
 *     package's own `--key-file` handling in packages/mcp-proxy) — a large `dir` with many
 *     long-lived tenants means a proportionally larger synchronous scan at every construction. This
 *     is a deliberate simplicity-over-throughput tradeoff for a session-position checkpoint, not a
 *     receipt-history archive (that remains --receipt-log's job — see this package's own module
 *     docstring in session-store.mjs: "does NOT keep a receipt log/history").
 *   - `advance()`'s memory-first ordering closes the "stale commit written to disk" bug, and its
 *     POISON latch closes "a CAUGHT disk-write error silently continuing" — but neither can close a
 *     genuine, uncatchable process crash (SIGKILL, power loss) landing in the narrow window between
 *     `inner.advance()` succeeding in memory and this module's own `appendLineSync()` call finishing
 *     (even with its `fsyncSync()`). On such a crash, the LAST receipt momentarily accepted in
 *     memory is not on disk at all when this process later restarts against the same `dir` —
 *     `reloadAll()` correctly resumes from the last GOOD line, one seq behind what the crashed
 *     process actually reached. If that same receipt was ALSO already durably recorded elsewhere
 *     (e.g. `packages/mcp-proxy`'s own `--receipt-log`, written by `onReceipt` BEFORE this module's
 *     own commit step runs), the very next post-restart receipt re-mints that same seq number, and a
 *     verifier merging the two logs correctly reports a duplicate-seq TAMPERED finding for what is
 *     actually an honest crash-recovery gap, not tampering. Closing this fully would require an
 *     atomic combined commit across both persistence layers (`advance()`) — out of scope for a
 *     session-position checkpoint; this module's `advance()`/POISON design protects against every
 *     CAUGHT failure, not an uncatchable crash mid-syscall.
 *   - The SAME orphaned-segment class above (a `segmentId` minted in memory but never disk-recorded)
 *     can ALSO occur without any crash at all: if a CAP-EVICTION's own tombstone write fails and
 *     poisons the store (see `onEvict`'s own doc comment below), the `peek()` call that triggered
 *     that eviction has ALREADY minted and returned an uncorrupted, freshly-numbered segment for a
 *     DIFFERENT, unrelated session — that segment's own commit is rejected closed by the very next
 *     `advance()` call (poison is now set), so it is never disk-recorded either. If the exact same
 *     `sessionId` later reconnects after a restart against the same `dir`, and no OTHER commit in the
 *     meantime reached that same segmentId on disk, `segmentCounterFloor` cannot see the orphaned
 *     mint and a fresh segment could be assigned the SAME `segmentId` — producing an actual
 *     `scope.chain` collision (not just a duplicate seq) between the orphaned pre-restart receipt (if
 *     it was independently persisted to `--receipt-log`) and the new post-restart segment. This is
 *     the same class of gap as the crash-window bullet above, triggered by a caught eviction failure
 *     instead of an uncatchable crash; closing it fully has the same out-of-scope cost.
 *   - `acquireLock()`'s stale-lock reclaim (`unlinkSync` then a fresh `wx` create) is two separate
 *     syscalls, not one atomic operation — two processes racing to reclaim the SAME dead lock at the
 *     SAME moment could each observe the dead pid, and interleave their own unlink+recreate calls
 *     such that both end up believing they hold the lock (the second one's `unlinkSync` deletes the
 *     first one's freshly-recreated file, then its own `wx` create succeeds against the now-empty
 *     path). This nonce fix protects `releaseLock()` from deleting a lock it no longer owns, but does
 *     NOT close this narrower reclaim-time race, which only opens in the moments right after BOTH a
 *     crash AND a near-simultaneous restart-race — a genuinely atomic fix for `acquireLock()` needs
 *     an OS-level advisory lock (`flock`) unavailable from plain `node:fs` without a native binding.
 *     `acquireLock()` is accepted as a known, narrow limitation rather than a half-fixed illusion of
 *     full atomicity.
 *   - HONEST LIMIT -- CROSS-TENANT SEEDING ORDER: `reloadAll()` (below) visits this `dir`'s
 *     `tenant-<sha256(tenant)>.jsonl` files in `readdirSync(dir)` order -- filesystem/directory-
 *     enumeration order, NOT any cross-tenant recency signal. WITHIN one tenant's own file,
 *     `seedSessions` for that tenant IS in genuine last-touch order (see the loop below). ACROSS
 *     tenants, `seedSessions` is simply each tenant's own last-touch-ordered sessions concatenated
 *     in `readdirSync` order. `createChainSessionStore`'s own `maxSessions`-truncation (see its
 *     `seedSessions` docstring in session-store.mjs) keeps only the LAST `maxSessions` entries of
 *     that concatenated array -- so once more than one tenant shares the cap and their combined
 *     session count exceeds it, WHICH TENANT's sessions survive a scale-down restart depends on
 *     directory-enumeration order, not on which tenant was actually touched most recently. The cap
 *     itself is never exceeded (this store never seeds more than `maxSessions` live sessions); only
 *     the cross-tenant SELECTION is enumeration-order-dependent. A dropped seed is not silently
 *     lost -- it is logged and simply starts a brand-new segment the next time that session is seen,
 *     exactly like any other eviction. Closing this fully would require `reloadAll()` to carry a
 *     real per-session last-touch signal across tenant files and sort `seedSessions` by it globally
 *     before truncation, instead of concatenating per-tenant slices in directory order -- out of
 *     scope for this store's current file-per-tenant layout.
