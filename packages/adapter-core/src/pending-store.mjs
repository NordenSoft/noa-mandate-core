/**
 * pending-store.mjs — the OPERATIONAL index for outstanding human-approval requests.
 *
 * Newline-delimited JSON (JSONL), append-only, event-sourced: current state of one request is
 * the fold of every line sharing its record identity — (tenant, sessionId, id) when session-scoped,
 * else the bare receipt id (see recordKeyOf). This is an OPERATIONAL INDEX ONLY — the CRYPTOGRAPHIC
 * record lives in the signed receipt chain (DEFERRED -> ALLOWED/BLOCKED -> EXECUTED). Honest
 * limit: if this file is lost, the receipt chain remains the source of truth; a lost entry just
 * means that ONE request can no longer be resolved through the CLI. No cross-process file lock in
 * v1 (CLI-driven scale) — the real atomicity backstop for double-consumption races is
 * `createChainSessionStore`'s in-memory `advance()`, in `packages/adapter-core/src/session-store.mjs`
 * (`adoptApprovedReceipt`).
 *
 * SYMLINK / TOCTOU HARDENING (CWE-59/CWE-367, 2026-08-12): every read and every append goes
 * through config-artifact.mjs's descriptor-level guard — `O_NOFOLLOW` open, `fstat` on the
 * DESCRIPTOR (regular file, owned by this process or root, not group/other-writable), then the I/O
 * on THAT SAME descriptor. The previous path-based `existsSync` + `readFileSync(path)` +
 * `appendFileSync(path)` followed a symlink, so anyone able to create a file in the store's
 * directory could redirect BOTH the outstanding-approval state this gate reads AND the append that
 * records a hold. The guard is re-applied on EVERY call, not once at startup: `loadPendingIndex`
 * runs per tool call, and a check that is not repeated at the moment of use is a TOCTOU wearing a
 * hat. Honest limit, unchanged by this: an attacker who rewrites the file's CONTENT IN PLACE as the
 * same uid is not stopped here — the signed receipt chain, not this index, is the cryptographic
 * record (see the paragraph above).
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED LOADING: any corrupt NON-EMPTY line makes the whole load refuse (PendingStoreError)
 * — never a silent skip. "Corrupt" includes a line that does not parse as JSON, one missing a
 * string `id`, AND one naming an `event` this store does not recognize (see KNOWN_EVENTS). The
 * single-use property of a ticket lives in the LAST event of its record ("consumed"); a loader that
 * skipped a torn/corrupt/unrecognized line would silently fold the record back to its PREVIOUS state
 * ("approved"), making an already-spent ticket consumable a second time (a replay). Refusing the
 * whole store until an operator repairs the file is the same
 * policy the sibling file-backed session store uses: on a security-bearing file, an unreadable
 * store must halt, never guess.

/** Folds one record's ordered events into its current state, enforcing the transitions that a legit
 *  event log actually obeys. Two rules are FAIL-CLOSED (throw PendingStoreError, refusing the WHOLE
 *  load — identical posture to loadPendingIndex's unparseable-line / unrecognized-event refusal):
 *
 *    - "created" is legal ONLY as the FIRST event of a record (from null). A SECOND "created" on an
 *      EXISTING record is rejected: the old permissive fold reset it straight back to "pending",
 *      silently WIPING a real "approved" (its actionId/paramsHash/deferredReceipt too) — a self-
 *      inflicted lockout / availability DoS an attacker with pending-store write access could trigger
 *      (see create-proxy-server.mjs's "anyone able to WRITE the pending-store file" threat class).
 *    - "consumed" is legal ONLY from "approved": a "consumed" with no live approval before it can
 *      never spend a ticket that was never granted.
 *    - Every non-"created" event additionally requires an EXISTING record (a bare ORPHAN
 *      approved/denied/consumed with no prior "created" is rejected — out-of-order tampering).
 *
 *  "approved"/"denied" are, by contrast, permitted onto ANY existing record — INCLUDING a "consumed"
 *  one. That is deliberate and load-bearing, NOT a hole: the store is an append-only OPERATIONAL index,
 *  and the proxy consumes a ticket BEFORE it verifies the approver signature (create-proxy-server.mjs),
 *  so a FORGED approval legitimately BURNS the ticket ("consumed") and the operator then appends a
 *  fresh, genuine "approved" to recover — the exact created->approved->consumed->approved sequence the
 *  mcp-proxy Scenario-R smoke exercises. Rejecting it here would break that recovery. Crucially, a
 *  re-"approved" fold state is NOT a single-use replay: single-use is enforced CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY, not
 *  by this index — adoptApprovedReceipt (session-store.mjs) rejects any ALLOWED receipt whose
 *  seq/prevHash/segmentId no longer match the CURRENT chain head, so a resurrected/replayed approval
 *  simply consumes-then-fails-to-adopt ("session chain has moved on"), never executing twice (proven
 *  by Scenario-R's own replay assertions). The pending-store fold is an operational convenience; the
 *  signed receipt chain is the source of truth (see the module docstring).
