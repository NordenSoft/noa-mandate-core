/**
 * BOUNDARY 2 — THE ONE CONVERSION FROM AN ARBITRARY THROWN VALUE TO A SAFE DESCRIPTOR.
 *
 * JavaScript lets you throw anything, and everything a handler naturally reaches for to describe
 * what it caught runs code the THROWER controls:
 *
 *   `e.message`            — a getter. It can throw. It can return an object. It can hang.
 *   `String(e)` / `${e}`   — runs `Symbol.toPrimitive`, then `toString`, then `valueOf`. Any of the
 *                            three can throw, and a thrown `null` from inside one of them lands in
 *                            an outer handler that then reads `.message` off `null`.
 *   `e instanceof Error`   — reads the prototype chain THROUGH the value. On a REVOKED PROXY the
 *                            `instanceof` itself throws `TypeError`, so the guard meant to make the
 *                            handler safe is the thing that breaks it.
 *   `Object.prototype.toString.call(e)` — consults `Symbol.toStringTag`, another attacker getter.
 *
 * Each of those failures happens INSIDE the handler whose job is to report a failure, so the honest
 * outcome is replaced by an unrelated internal error. In this codebase that is not cosmetic:
 *
 *   • `framework-adapters` loses `ToolOutcomeNotRecorded`, whose `executionHappened === true` is the
 *     ONE signal telling a caller "this already ran, retrying duplicates the side effect". A hostile
 *     value turns an already-executed operation into what looks like an ordinary failure — and the
 *     correct response to an ordinary failure is to retry it.
 *   • `mcp-proxy` loses the ERROR outcome receipt: the tool ran, and nothing durable records that.
 *   • `gate` loses the consumption artifact for a dispatch that really happened, leaving the grant
 *     reservation dangling.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A FIX AT EACH SITE. Round 3 hardened thirteen sites; round 4
 * found four more, in the same shape, in the same packages. Per-site conversion means per-site
 * omission, and the omissions are invisible until someone reproduces the next one. There is now ONE
 * conversion, held to the four rules below, and `scripts/lint-thrown-value-handling.mjs` fails the
 * build when any handler in the governed packages touches a caught value any other way.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS SENTENCE CARRIED A K5-BANNED ABSOLUTE about the conversion itself. Corrected 2026-08-04,
 * caught the hour that term entered the publish-surface lint's set — this file ships in
 * `noa-mcp-adapter-core`, so it was published text making an unfalsifiable claim.
 *
 * What is true is stronger for being sayable: ONE conversion instead of seventeen, four auditable
 * rules, and a mechanical gate that fails the build on any bypass. What was NOT true is the absolute.
 * This project's whole defect record is controls described that way being broken anyway, three
 * releases running — the rules below are a discipline, not a proof.
 *
 * Writing this note cost two attempts. The first named the banned term while explaining it, and the
 * gate refused that too — correctly, because an explanation shipped inside a published package is
 * published text. **A banned absolute cannot be discussed on the published surface, only replaced.**
 *
 * THE RULES THIS MODULE HOLDS ITSELF TO (audit them — they are the whole contract):
 *   1. Nothing in here reads a property of the untrusted value outside a `try`.
 *   2. No bare `instanceof`; Error-ness is probed inside a `try` and a throw means "not proven".
 *   3. No bare `String()`/interpolation of the untrusted value; every coercion is inside a `try`.
 *   4. Every exported function returns a value for EVERY input. None of them can throw. A hostile
 *      value gets a truthful placeholder, never an exception and never a silent empty string.
 *   5. Identity is never touched: this module describes, it never re-wraps or replaces. Callers
 *      re-throw the ORIGINAL value.
 *
 * Zero dependencies, no I/O, safe to call from any package (gate imports it through
 * `noa-mcp-adapter-core/safe-throw`).

 *   2. falsy primitives — `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `-0`, `""`, `false`, `NaN`, `0n` are all legal
 *      to throw and all used to collapse into "no error" at sites that tested truthiness. Each is
 *      named EXPLICITLY here, because "a falsy thrown value is still a throw".
 *   3. a real `message` string, read inside a `try`.
 *   4. the `[object Tag]` brand / constructor name, read inside a `try`.
 *   5. `String(value)`, inside a `try`.
 *   6. `<unstringifiable …>` — the honest answer when the value fights every probe. Note this is
 *      still a DESCRIPTION, not a failure: the caller keeps its own control flow.
