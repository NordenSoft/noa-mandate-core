 * No auto re-execution here (avoids a TOCTOU between decision and execution, and keeps execution
 * authority with the agent): this module only records a signed DECISION + (on approve) a single-use
 * TTL'd ticket; actual execution happens later, when the agent retries and the proxy sees the
 * ticket (create-proxy-server.mjs).
 *
 * Signs with its OWN identity (`agent.id: "human-approval-cli"` by default, principal HUMAN) —
 * never the agent's private key; per-agent.id key-pinning (enforced by verifyChain's identity
 * manifest) is what keeps this safe within one chain.

// `authorizedKids.includes(sig.kid)`, and a post-load `Array.prototype.includes = () => true`
// authorized a co-trusted key into the human-approval seat with a genuine signature, a trusted key
// and an untampered receipt — nothing upstream fires, because nothing upstream is wrong. Only the
// seat binding breaks, and that binding is the product.
//
// The root kernel has enforced this since the intrinsics work; the PACKAGES were never linted for
// it, so the rule existed and its coverage stopped at the repository root. Reproduced, then fixed:
// see "a poisoned Array.prototype.includes cannot authorize a co-trusted key into the approval seat".

 * re-export it, and its only public verifier, `verifyChain`, authenticates a WHOLE chain from
 * genesis (contiguous seq 0..n-1). An approval is minted for a DEFERRED hold that can legitimately
 * sit at ANY seq > 0 (a session may EXECUTE small calls before a big one is held), and the live
 * proxy holds only the chain HEAD — never the full prior chain — so the [deferred, allowed] pair is
 * NOT a genesis-rooted chain and verifyChain would (correctly, but unhelpfully) report a seq-gap.
 * verifyApprovalReceipt below therefore re-assembles the EXACT signed message from noa-receipt's OWN
 * exported primitives (receiptHashInput + sha256Digest + verifyEd25519) — it invents no hash and no
 * signature scheme, only mirrors the one-line domain framing the library keeps internal. Any drift
 * here can ONLY fail closed (a real approval would stop verifying — caught immediately by the
 * approval-decision + proxy Scenario R tests), never admit a forgery.

/**
 * verifyApprovalReceipt — the fail-closed inverse of buildApprovalReceipt. Before a proxy adopts an
 * externally-built ALLOWED receipt onto its live session chain, it MUST prove the receipt is a
 * genuine, signed human approval — not just structurally consistent seq/prevHash (which anyone able
 * to write the pending-store file could forge). Checks, in order, ALL fail-closed:
 *   (a) a trusted approver keyring is supplied at all;
 *   (b) verdict is exactly "ALLOWED" and governance.approval carries a human (by/at);
 *   (c) scope.chain matches this session's live chain (when `expectedChain` is given);
 *   (d) the receipt's content hash recomputes (the SAME integrity check verifyChain does);
 *   (e) the signing kid is present in the trusted approver keyring AND its Ed25519 signature over
 *       the receipt is valid;
 *   (f) when an `identityManifest` is given, the signing kid is authorized for the receipt's
 *       agent.id (the approval seat) — so a co-trusted key can never impersonate the human seat.
 *   (g) when an `expectedAction` ({ id, paramsHash }) is given, the receipt's OWN action.id +
 *       action.paramsHash MUST equal it — the approval is cryptographically bound to the EXACT held
 *       action. Without this, a genuine, validly-signed approval for action X (e.g. a small refund a
 *       low-privilege approver may sign) could be adopted to authorize a DIFFERENT held action Y (a
 *       large refund) on the same chain: signature + chain verify, but the human never approved Y.
 *
 * Returns `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, reason }` — returns rather than throwing (any unexpected throw is caught
 * and reported as a failure, i.e. fail-closed). See the RECEIPT_SIG_DOMAIN note above for why this
 * verifies a single receipt directly rather than calling verifyChain.
