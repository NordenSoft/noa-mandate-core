/**
 * policy-change-guard.mjs — spec §19.3 META-RULE (RED LINE): a policy change IS itself a risky action.
 *
 * Editing the approval policy (adding/removing/weakening an approval rule) must route through the
 * SAME hold -> approve -> receipt pipeline every other risky action uses. Otherwise the settings
 * screen is the attacker's first stop: silently weaken the guardrail, then strike. This module is the
 * FAIL-CLOSED enforcement point — `applyPolicyChange` is the ONLY function that returns a new active
 * ruleset, and it refuses unless a genuine, signed human approval, cryptographically bound to the
 * EXACT rule-diff, is presented. A user/attacker cannot silently weaken their own guardrails.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT "BOUND TO THE EXACT RULE-DIFF" RESTS ON, since the sentence above is the kind a reader stops
 * testing. It rests on the diff being taken over COMPILED SNAPSHOTS of both sides rather than over
 * the caller's live objects — and until 2026-08-12 it was not: a `toJSON` on a proposed rule returned
 * the CURRENT rule's bytes, so a real weakening reported "changed: false", no approval was requested
 * at all, and the raised threshold was installed. The binding is only as good as the representation
 * it is computed from, and the exported `buildPolicyChangeRequest`/`canonicalizeApprovalRules` still
 * accept live arrays for direct callers (see the follow-up note at `buildPolicyChangeRequest`).
 *
 * SCHEMA-FROZEN (Red Line 5): this is a POLICY layer, not a receipt-schema change. The approval is
 * receipted with the existing v0.1 format — `action.id: "noa.policy.update"`, `action.paramsHash` =
 * hash of the canonical rule-diff — via the existing preCheck() / buildApprovalReceipt() /
 * verifyApprovalReceipt() primitives. No signed field is added.
 *
 * Reuses (the reuse-first rule — extend, don't reinvent):
 *   - canonicalParamsHash (pre-check.mjs) so the diff hash here is byte-identical to the paramsHash
 *     preCheck independently computes for a `{ name:"noa.policy.update", args:<diff> }` tool call;
 *   - verifyApprovalReceipt (approval-decision.mjs) for the fail-closed, action-bound authenticity check;
 *   - compileApprovalRules (approval-rules.mjs) to refuse an invalid proposed policy outright AND to
 *     produce the inert snapshot this function hands back as the new active rule set.
 *
 * Deferred (documented follow-ups, NOT in this slice): §19.2 PWA settings surface, §19.4 enterprise
 * floor, §19.5 learning/shadow suggestions. Step-up (D4) is enforced here as a caller-asserted
 * boolean (`stepUpVerified`) because binding the step-up proof INTO the signed receipt would require a
 * new signed field — forbidden by Red Line 5; that cryptographic binding is a documented follow-up.

// REDTEAM 2026-08-03. `classifyPolicyChange` decided whether the ruleset had changed with a LIVE
// `JSON.stringify`, and "not changed" is the branch that applies a proposal WITHOUT an approval.
// One assignment collapsed every comparison to equal, and a rule weakened from a 4000 threshold to
// 99_999_999 — after which nothing ever needs human approval again — applied silently:
//
//     CONTROL unpoisoned  { ok:false, changed:true,  code:"approval-required" }
//     ATTACK  poisoned    { ok:true,  changed:false }   applied threshold 99999999
//
// Changing the policy is the strongest bypass there is: it does not forge one approval, it removes
// the requirement for all of them. Every builtin this file reaches for on that path is now taken
// from the kernel's module-load capture.
// ROUND 3 — THE THIRD FIX IN THIS FUNCTION, AND THE FIRST ONE AIMED AT THE CLASS.
// Round 2 hardened the named builtins; round 3 reproduced three MORE bypasses in the same code by
// poisoning the ones that had not been named: `Object.keys`, `Array.prototype.map`, and the array
// ITERATOR itself. Naming poisons one at a time is a race against whoever writes the next line.
//
// Iteration over caller-owned arrays on a decision path is now an INDEX LOOP. An index loop
// dispatches through no method at all — there is no `next`, no `map`, no `forEach` to replace — so
// the class is closed rather than its current members. This is the same move the kernel made when
// its key walk and code-point walk became index loops.
// ROUND 4 — A DISPATCH CLASS THE GATES CANNOT NAME.
// Rounds 1-3 were all builtin READS or CALLS. This one is a property WRITE: `out[k] = v` performs
// `[[Set]]`, which WALKS THE PROTOTYPE CHAIN, so an accessor installed on Object.prototype swallows
// the write and the canonical copy silently loses a field. Measured: 4 writes swallowed, a weakening
// from 4000 to 99,999,999 applied with NO approval and NO step-up — and **not one builtin was
// replaced**. L2/L8 model dispatch as a call or a read; they have no grammar for a write, so
// `policy-change-guard.mjs:93` appears in NONE of the 298 budgeted findings. 37 such sites were
// measured across the two published packages.
//
// The fix is structural, not another captured name: a null-prototype object has no chain to walk, so
// `[[Set]]` cannot be intercepted at all. Same reason the kernel gives arrays an inert prototype.
