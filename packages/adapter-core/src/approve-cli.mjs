/**
 * approve-cli.mjs — `noa-approve`: the v1 human-approval interface for a DEFERRED receipt.
 *
 *   noa-approve approve --id <deferredReceiptId> --by <email> --pending-store <path> --key-file <path> [--receipt-log <path>] [--ttl-ms <n>]
 *   noa-approve deny    --id <deferredReceiptId> --by <email> --reason <text> --pending-store <path> --key-file <path> [--receipt-log <path>]
 *
 * Signs with its OWN approver identity (never the agent's key) and records only a signed decision
 * plus a single-use ticket — it never itself re-executes the held action (that happens later, when
 * the agent retries and the proxy consumes the ticket).
 *
 * D8 / GDPR-CCPA: the raw `--by` email is pseudonymized to an opaque `hmac-sha256:` approver id
 * (opaque-id.mjs) before it enters the SIGNED receipt, and the free-text `--reason` is NEVER signed
 * (kept only in the local pending-store index). No raw PII rests in the signed, hash-chained bytes.
 * Deterministic exit codes: 0 success, 1 usage/runtime error (never a raw uncaught throw).

  // other step that can fail has to fail BEFORE it.
  //
  // The pre-fix order was `recordApproved(...)` and only then `appendReceiptLog(...)`, both inside
  // one try that returns exit 1. Pointing `--receipt-log` at a DIRECTORY made the log write throw
  // EISDIR: the approver's shell reported exit 1 — "the approval failed" — while the pending store
  // already held `created, approved`, and the retried tool call executed a 7000-minor-unit transfer.
  // The approver was told the approval failed and the money moved. The deny branch had the mirror
  // shape: a denial durably recorded while its own log write fails is reported to the operator as a
  // denial that did not happen.
  //
  // Fixed by making the pending-store write the LAST FALLIBLE step in BOTH branches.
  //
  // WHAT THE RESIDUAL ACTUALLY IS — stated precisely, because an earlier version of this comment
  // said the leftover log line "leaves the action STILL HELD", and a review reproduced that that is
  // only half true. The literal half holds and was verified: NO decision path in this repo reads a
  // receipt log (the pending store's only consumers are pending-store.mjs, this file, index.mjs and
  // mcp-proxy's create-proxy-server.mjs; proxy.mjs's appender is write-only), so an orphaned line
  // authorizes nothing by itself. The absolute half is FALSE: the orphan is a validly-signed
  // ALLOWED receipt and it carries NO expiry of its own — the TTL and the ticket live only in the
  // store EVENT, and `buildApprovalReceipt` mints the ticket outside the signed bytes. A same-uid
  // writer of the pending store can therefore append a crafted "approved" event carrying that
  // orphan and a self-minted ticket, and pending-store.mjs:118-129 deliberately folds "approved"
  // onto a DENIED record — so a request the human actively denied becomes consumable. Severity is
  // LOW (it is an action the human genuinely signed once, and it needs the same-uid pending-store
  // writer that pending-store.mjs's own docstring already declares out of scope for content
  // defence), but the artifact is NOT inert and no comment here should say it is. The failing path
  // now says so on stderr — see orphanedLogWarning above.
  //
  // "LAST FALLIBLE", not "last durable": `appendConfigArtifact` (config-artifact.mjs) does
  // open -> writeFileSync -> close with NO fsync, while the sibling file-session-store.mjs:280-297
  // does fsync and documents why. So a power loss can still lose a returned "approved". The safe
  // direction holds (a lost approval leaves the action held), but the two stores in this perimeter
  // sit at different durability bars, and closing that means adding the fsync in
