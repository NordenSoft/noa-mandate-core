 * Sits between an MCP host and its tool servers. For EVERY tool call it runs the
 * DETERMINISTIC policy evaluator `evaluate(policy, inputs)` (noa-receipt's offline-replayable
 * policy engine, imported from the noa-receipt package) and returns a SIGNED receipt of the
 * ALLOW/DENY decision. FAIL-CLOSED: any policy/input error resolves to DENY, not a throw for any input shape reached in practice (a revoked Proxy is the measured exception, R4-11),
 * never a silent allow.
 *
 * Dependency note: this module consumes noa-receipt as a published registry dependency
 * (`^0.4.0`, see package.json), imported by its package name. The receipt builder, policy
 * evaluator, and hash helpers below all resolve from that package's public entry point.

 * what was wrong. It is corrected in place rather than deleted, because "never" in a fail-closed
 * contract is precisely the kind of word a reader stops testing.

 * both produce the exact path `args.a.b`. A caller can exploit this as a DECOY: present a genuine
 * over-limit nested value (`{transfer: {amount: 999999999}}`, which is what actually gets forwarded
 * to — and executed by — the downstream tool, UNMODIFIED) alongside a literal dotted key at the same
 * flattened path (`"transfer.amount": 1`) whose small, innocuous value happens to win the
 * insertion-order collision in the policy's view. `flattenArgsToPolicyInputs` itself no longer
 * silently resolves this collision one way or the other: `findAmbiguousDottedArgKey()` (below) scans
 * for ANY raw key containing "." anywhere in `args` FIRST, and `preCheck()` fails the ENTIRE call
