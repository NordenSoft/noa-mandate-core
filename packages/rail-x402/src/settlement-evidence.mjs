/**
 * S4 — `reconcileSettlementEvidence`: verification layers 4 (self-consistency / mandate equality)
 * and 6 (chain reconciliation) for a `noa.settlement-evidence/0.1` artifact, over PRE-VERIFIED
 * inputs, under the REVISION-3 / D7 correlation contract.
 *
 * ── READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A POSITIVE RESULT (R-12b) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT AUTHENTICATE THE ARTIFACT. Layers 1–3 and 5 — the artifact's schema, its
 * observer Ed25519 signature, the F15 signer type/role matrix, key activation/revocation, and the
 * caller's time policies over the generic artifact — are owned by the `approval-artifacts` generic
 * verifier and the evidence pipeline, NOT here. A positive result from this function over inputs
 * that never went through those layers means NOTHING: an attacker can hand-assemble a perfectly
 * self-consistent artifact and this function will happily find it self-consistent. What this
 * function DOES authenticate, itself, is the two BUNDLE documents the correlation is recomputed
 * from: the receipt chain and the execution grant go through the kernel's `verifyActionDigest`,
 * which is the AUTHENTICATING entry point (bytes-in; runs `verifyChain` over the receipt chain and
 * verifies the grant's Ed25519 signature against the caller keyring). Bare `buildActionDigest` is
 * used ONLY to mint the claim that `verifyActionDigest` then authenticates and recomputes
 * end-to-end — the acceptance path never rests on the bare builder, whose own header names that
 * conflation as the mistake it exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── THE D7 CORRELATION CONTRACT (revision 3, 2026-08-13 — supersedes revision 2's D2) ───────────
 *   dispatchId = the `noa.action-digest/0.1` value AS ITS ASCII STRING "sha256:<64hex>"
 *                (the "sha256:" prefix IS part of the preimage)
 *   seed       = the 32 bytes hex-decoded from `grant.nonce` (schema-pinned `^[0-9a-f]{64}$`)
 *   chainId    = parsed from the VERIFIED params preimage's `networkCaip2` ("eip155:8453" → 8453)
 *   token      = parsed from the VERIFIED params preimage's `assetCaip19`
 *   payer      = the VERIFIED params preimage's `payer`
 *   nonce      = deriveCorrelationNonce({chainId, tokenAddress, payerAddress, dispatchId, seed})
 * The artifact's `correlation` carries the nonce in its on-chain form `0x<64hex>`. There is no seed
 * field anywhere: the grant IS the pre-dispatch seed commitment, so one grant derives exactly one
 * nonce and a sibling-seed settlement (same grant, different seed) can settle on-chain but can
 * NEVER earn a positive verdict — recomputation from the bundle's own documents yields THE nonce.
 *
 * DERIVATION-INPUT PROVENANCE IS NORMATIVE: chainId / token / payer come ONLY from the spec-§4
 * hash-verified canonical params preimage — never from the artifact, never from
 * `receipt.scope.chain` (an opaque receipt-chain identifier unrelated to any EVM chainId). A keyed
 * (`hmac-sha256:`) paramsHash blocks bounds AND blocks derivation (SETTLEMENT_BOUNDS_UNCHECKABLE).
 *
 * ── THE ENVELOPE (spec §6, R-MAP-2) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every return is the full result envelope, every field present, and the function NEVER throws
 * (R-1). One documented extension: a two-valued status field that was never reached reads
 * "UNCHECKED" (the same never-absent discipline R-MAP-2 mandates for boundsStatus), and the
 * envelope carries a `reason` member so a refusal's cause travels verbatim (R-MAP-1 #6).
 * `witnessTrustStatus` is constantly "UNKNOWN" here: the F15 trust matrix over the observer key is
 * layer 2's, and reporting a value this function did not derive would be a claim without a control.
 *
 * ── WHY `provesSettlement` IS NOT REUSED AS THE LAYER-6 CORE (reuse first, stated not skipped) ──────
 * `provesSettlement` (S3) consumes a chain-READER observation — a decoded call, a numeric tx
 * status, an explicit (authorizer, nonce) — produced by this package's own injected reader.
 * Layer 6 here consumes the BYTE-PARSED `noa.chain-facts/0.1` record a RELYING PARTY supplies:
 * same shape family, different invariant (R-0's byte boundary, R-17b's provenance rule, R-19's
 * route/uniqueness constraints, R-20's normalized reject-only corroboration). Forcing one function
 * over both would couple a producer-side reader contract to a verifier-side trust boundary that
 * must evolve independently. `deriveCorrelationNonce` IS reused — it is the one shared rule.

// ── L11 inert-container discipline (same pattern as settlement-proof.mjs) ───────────────────────
// The warnings buffer is filled on the decision path; an ordinary [] would take [[Set]] writes
// that walk to the mutable Object.prototype, where a planted accessor can swallow a warning while
// length still advances — a silently de-fanged cap. Re-rooted while EMPTY, written through the
// captured arrayPush, copied out through the kernel's publication boundary (an index walk with a
// captured push — never the iterator protocol).
//
// ── EVERY COMPUTATION THAT CAN MOVE A VERDICT DISPATCHES THROUGH A LOAD-TIME CAPTURE ────────────
// The bindings below are read ONCE, when the kernel module is evaluated, before any caller-supplied
// value has been read and therefore before any hostile code could have run. After that, rewriting
// `Buffer.from`, `RegExp.prototype.exec`, `String.prototype.toLowerCase`, `Date.UTC` or any other
// shared slot is inert against this file: the poisoned property is simply never consulted again.
//
// Each of the following was REPRODUCED flipping a real verdict on the committed corpus before the
// call site was routed through a capture, which is why the list is this long rather than this
// short:
//   • the RFC 3339 grammar match and the epoch arithmetic — a fabricated in-window match, or a
//     constant epoch, turned a two-hour-stale settlement into a positive; one poison neutralises
//     freshness, the ordering arm and the instant-comparison arm at once;
//   • the correlation derivation's byte conversions — a stateful poison records one settlement's
//     derivation inputs during an ordinary verification and replays them into the next, so a second
//     genuinely signed bundle earns the first one's verdict;
//   • the address/hash normalisation used by every chain binding — a rewritten `toLowerCase`
//     made a foreign nonce, a foreign authorizer, a foreign transaction and a decoy token all
//     compare equal to ours;
//   • the byte compare behind the same-signing-key cap and the decode behind the params preimage.
// ⚠ THE CEILING: a poison installed BEFORE the kernel loads is snapshotted, not defeated. That is
// stated as a non-claim (NON-CLAIMS.md §S4) and no in-process defence can close it.
