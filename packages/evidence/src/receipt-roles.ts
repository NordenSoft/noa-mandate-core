/**
 * BOUNDARY 1 — RECEIPT SEMANTIC INTEGRITY (the one chokepoint every receipt-role assertion passes).
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, AS A CLASS. Every receipt in a bundle is checked to be cryptographically sound:
 * `verifyChain` proves each one is signed by a key the manifest authorizes, contiguous with its
 * predecessor and covered by the checkpoint. What was NOT checked, uniformly, is the OTHER half of
 * the same claim: that the signer attested a verdict APPROPRIATE TO THE ROLE the bundle assigns the
 * receipt. `blockedReceipt` had that check (step 7). `timeoutReceipt` had it (step 8).
 * `executedReceipt` (step 10) and `failedReceipt` (step 11) had it. `allowedReceipt` — the receipt
 * the entire APPROVED branch, every execution grant and every "a human said yes" claim rests on —
 * did NOT, on ANY of the six outcomes that carry it. Neither did `deferredReceipt`, the receipt the
 * Hold Envelope binds and the chain is rooted on.
 *
 * The consequence is not theoretical and needs no key compromise beyond the one the threat model
 * already assumes for the approver's own device: rebuild `allowedReceipt` with
 * `governance.verdict: "BLOCKED"`, sign it with the SAME approver key, re-bind
 * `holdResolution.verdictReceiptHash` with the gate key, rebuild the checkpoint. Every signature is
 * real and every hash binds. The verifier returned VALID_FULL_CHAIN for a bundle whose "approval"
 * receipt says the action was BLOCKED. Same for FAILED, EXECUTED and DEFERRED. A bundle that is
 * cryptographically self-consistent and semantically self-contradictory is not valid evidence.
 *
 * WHY PER-SITE PATCHING KEPT MISSING IT. Four of the six roles were checked, each in the step that
 * happened to consume it, because a reviewer reproduced an exploit AT THAT SITE and the fix landed
 * AT THAT SITE. Nothing in the codebase expressed "a receipt playing role R must attest a verdict
 * appropriate to R" as ONE rule with ONE enforcement point, so the two roles nobody had reproduced
 * yet stayed open — and a SEVENTH role added tomorrow would start open too.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS. The table below is the invariant, in one place. `assertReceiptRole` is the
 * only way to obtain a receipt BY ROLE: it cannot hand back the object without having checked what
 * its signer attested, so "this receipt plays role R here" and "its signer attested a verdict fit
 * for R" cannot be separated by a caller. Every access is recorded in an assertion set, and
 * `step19_receiptRoleIntegrity` fails closed on any role field the bundle carries that no step ever
 * routed through here — so a future role wired into a new step without the check does not ship: it
 * turns the suite red on its own outcome's VALID fixture.

 *
 *   deferredReceipt — the hold's ROOT: the action was frozen pending a decision, nothing ran.
 *                     `DEFERRED` only. An `ALLOWED`/`EXECUTED` receipt in the root position would
 *                     mean the envelope froze an action that had already been decided or run.
 *   allowedReceipt  — the approval itself (§8: the approver's device signs it). `ALLOWED` only.
 *   blockedReceipt  — the human denial (step 7 additionally binds it to a DENY decision).
 *   timeoutReceipt  — the POLICY-signed expiry (step 8 additionally requires principal POLICY +
 *                     ruleId `approval-timeout`). A timeout is a form of block: `BLOCKED`.
 *   executedReceipt — the terminal success attestation. `EXECUTED` only.
 *   failedReceipt   — the terminal failure attestation. `FAILED` only.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCOPE: this table owns the VERDICT dimension of role fitness and nothing else. Signer
 * identity/tier (steps 1/5/18), chain contiguity (step 17), hash bindings (steps 2/3/6) and the
 * per-outcome policy details (steps 7-14) stay where they are — this closes the one dimension that
 * had no single home.
