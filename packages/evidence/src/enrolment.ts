/**
 * S5 — THE ENROLMENT PLANE (R4-R7) AND THE SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT IT UNLOCKS (R8/R9).
 *
 * ── WHAT ENROLMENT IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE BUNDLE ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "This action class requires settlement evidence before EXECUTED may be believed" is a statement
 * about a TENANT'S GOVERNANCE. It is not a statement about the bundle it adjudicates, and it must
 * not travel with it: a producer that holds the document saying "I owe you a witness" can simply
 * delete it, and if absence meant "unenrolled" the attacker would win by removing a file.
 *
 * So the registry is a VERIFIER INPUT — the third external document this verifier already takes,
 * beside `--tenant-root` and `--checkpoint-keyring` — and absence is never "unenrolled". Absence is
 * "the question was not asked", which changes no answer at all.
 *
 * ── THE ONE PROPERTY THAT GOVERNS EVERY RULE BELOW ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   SUPPLYING A REGISTRY MAY ONLY EVER MAKE THE VERDICT HARDER TO REACH.
 *
 * Nothing a signer writes into a registry, and nothing a signer OMITS from one, buys a positive that
 * supplying no registry would not also have given. That sentence is load-bearing and it was FALSE in
 * an earlier design: there, a class positively absent from a `closed:true` registry received the
 * legacy positive with no settlement evidence at all — so a registry NARROWED to omit the payment
 * class was MORE permissive for that class than one that enrolled it, and the same document
 * recommended narrowing. Under these rules an absent class is `UNVERIFIED`. A signer can no longer
 * buy a verdict by omission.
 *
 * The only route to the permissive regime is a RELYING PARTY supplying no registry — its own
 * configuration decision, which no producer and no signer can make for it. That residual is conceded
 * and not claimed closed: it is the migration guarantee and the escape read from two sides.
 *
 * ── WHY `closed: true` IS REQUIRED BUT BUYS ALMOST NOTHING ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is the signer stating "for this audience, in this window, these are all the classes I make any
 * statement about at all". It gates whether the registry may be CONSULTED. It never makes an
 * omission permissive — a class outside a consulted registry is UNANSWERED. That is a strictly
 * weaker role than "an absence is a positive statement of non-enrolment", and it is the only role a
 * signed document can honestly play here.
 *
 * ── WHY `audience` IS MANDATORY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Without it, "a registry scoped to one relying party" and "a policy downgrade" are the same bytes,
 * and a verifier holding two registries cannot tell intentional governance from an attack. It sits
 * INSIDE the signature, so a reader cannot be handed a registry written for somebody else and have
 * it silently apply — and a registry naming a different audience is NOT SELECTED rather than
 * REJECTED, which is why that outcome is `UNVERIFIED` and not `INVALID`. It costs nothing in
 * permissiveness, because no registry content can buy a positive.

 *
 * ── TWO ADJUDICATIONS THE SPEC TEXT LEFT CONTRADICTORY, DECIDED HERE AND WRITTEN DOWN ────────────
 *
 * (a) The rule table says selection requires "tenant-matched" AND lists "wrong tenant" as a
 *     structural CONTRADICTION. Both cannot hold: one silently drops the registry, the other
 *     accuses it. Decided: a registry that does not AUTHENTICATE under this reader's root is
 *     unverifiable (it could be anyone's); a registry that DOES authenticate under this root while
 *     declaring a different tenant is a contradiction, because our own governance signed a document
 *     about someone else and it was presented against this bundle. Authentication first, then
 *     audience, then tenant.
 *
 * (b) The rule table places the structural-contradiction scan BEFORE the window check. Applied
 *     literally to ROWS, that turns ordinary registry ROTATION into a hard `INVALID`: after a
 *     projection re-build the OLD registry — correctly out of window — still carries the OLD hash
 *     for the same class, which is exactly the "same class, different hash" shape the contradiction
 *     rule refuses. Decided: REGISTRY-level contradictions (tenant) keep their position; ROW-level
 *     contradictions are evaluated only on IN-WINDOW registries. A superseded registry is not a
 *     contradiction, it is a superseded registry — and the window rule stays reject-only either way,
 *     since being in window still establishes nothing on its own.

  // There is no runtime check for either, and the absence is a DECISION with a consequence worth

  //
  // Both members are pinned to a single value by the shipped schema (`claimTier` is a one-member
  // enum, `witnessSpec` a const), and every registry is validated against that schema before it can
  // be selected. So a row declaring a weaker tier does not produce a WEAKER ENROLMENT — it produces
  // a document that does not authenticate at all. Measured: a re-signed `claimTier: SELF_REPORTED`
  // registry returns `UNVERIFIED / E_ENROLMENT_UNVERIFIABLE`, the same answer as any other registry
  // this reader cannot use, and NOT `INCONCLUSIVE / E_SETTLEMENT_REQUIRED`.
  //
  // That is the stronger outcome and it is why no branch is written here: a check for a value the
  // grammar cannot deliver is a control that cannot fire, which is worse than none because it reads
  // in review as a defence. The enum's enforcement is measured by the `reject-unknown-claim-tier`
  // conformance vector — at the layer that owns document shape, once.

/**
 * THE I3 CARRY-FORWARD — an enrolled class's FAILURE outcome may not be positive on the gate's word.
 *
 * ── THE ASYMMETRY, MEASURED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `EXECUTION_FAILED` is one of the two POSITIVE outcomes, so it pays no step-15 fresh-checkpoint tax.
 * Once enrolment makes `EXECUTED` cost a witness, it becomes the ONLY outcome that is both
 * step-15-exempt AND settlement-free — i.e. the cheap relabelling path for a gate hiding a spend.
 * Claim the failure, pay nothing, exit 0.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS RULE DOES, AND THE TWO THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ──────────────────────────
 *
 * For an ENROLLED class the gate's own `FAILED_BEFORE_DISPATCH` is not sufficient on its own. A
 * determinate negative is claimable only where a party OTHER than the executed one observed the
 * non-dispatch, and no artifact admitted on this outcome carries such an observation — the outcome
 * union admits neither settlement member here, deliberately and under an owner-gated decision. So
 * for an enrolled class this outcome cannot presently reach a positive at all, and the honest
 * verdict is `INCONCLUSIVE`: the question was asked and nothing admissible answered it.
 *
 * It does NOT widen `POSITIVE_OUTCOMES`, and it does NOT widen the outcome-artifact union to admit a
 * witness on this outcome. Both are the owner's call, and the pressure this rule puts on that
 * decision is the point: the requirement is now visible as a refusal instead of invisible as a gap.
 *
 * It is scoped to ENROLLED classes ONLY. With no registry supplied nothing changes — every
 * historical `EXECUTION_FAILED` bundle keeps its verdict, its step, its code and its exit code.
