 * The bundle is an **outcome-keyed union** (each `outcome` carries ONLY the artifacts that exist
 * for it, §13). It reuses — never redefines — the receipt (`noa-receipt`), the signed side
 * artifacts (`noa-approval-artifacts`), and the signed `noa.checkpoint/0.1` head anchor (F4). The
 * container itself is NOT signed: every artifact inside carries its own signature (§6).
 *
 * These types are intentionally structural (`unknown`-shaped sub-artifacts): the sub-artifact
 * SHAPES are frozen upstream and are validated at verify-time by the shipped schemas +
 * `verifyArtifact`, not re-declared here (Red Line 5: never re-invent a frozen shape).

/**
 * POLICY STATE IS FROZEN BY CONSTRUCTION (review #6, C3).
 *
 * Review #5 found a runtime-mutable `Set` in a frozen policy table and it was fixed IN ONE FILE.
 * Every table in THIS file stayed a `Set` — and `Object.freeze` does not disable `Set.prototype.add`,
 * so `NEGATIVE_OUTCOMES.delete("CANCELLED_LOCAL_STATE_LOST")` +
 * `POSITIVE_OUTCOMES.add("CANCELLED_LOCAL_STATE_LOST")` turned `step15-laundering-no-anchor.json`
 * from INCONCLUSIVE / E_INCONCLUSIVE_NO_CHECKPOINT into VALID_SEGMENT_ONLY, and
 * `OPTIONAL_ARTIFACT_FIELDS.push(...)` simply worked.
 *
 * Hand-freezing the tables a review happens to name does not close this: the NEXT table is mutable
 * again. Two mechanisms replace the discipline:
 *
 *   1. `frozenSet` / `frozenTable` (noa-receipt) — a membership table with no `Set` inside it, and a
 *      deep-freeze that THROWS at construction on a `Set`/`Map`/`Date`/accessor/class instance and
 *      re-roots every array onto the inert prototype. A mutable policy table cannot be built; the
 *      module fails to evaluate, in every process including the build.
 *   2. `test/security/policy-tables-inert.test.ts` — walks EVERY exported value of EVERY package
 *      entry point and requires the same invariant of tables that never came through (1). A new table
 *      in a new file is covered without anyone remembering this comment.
