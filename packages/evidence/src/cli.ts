 * `noa verify-evidence <bundle.json> --tenant-root <f> --checkpoint-keyring <f> [--now <ts>]
 *  [--max-age-hours <n>]`
 *
 * Offline, network-free. Prints the tiered verdict + the ordered per-step audit trail as JSON and
 * exits with a code derived from `(verdict, enrolment, dimensions.settlement)`:
 *   0  VALID_FULL_CHAIN | VALID_SEGMENT_ONLY | VALID_FROM_TRUSTED_ANCHOR  (verified)
 *   2  INVALID                                  (a hard, fail-closed rejection at a named step)
 *   3  INCONCLUSIVE                             (a non-executed outcome with no fresh trusted checkpoint)
 *   4  UNVERIFIED                               (no external trust root / checkpoint keyring supplied, F7a)
 *   5  usage / IO error
 *   6  INCONCLUSIVE                             (the settlement question was asked and not answered)
 *      DEFINED, and NOT REACHABLE from this build — no rule here assigns a settlement value that
 *      produces it. The first rule that can is the one admitting a settlement artifact with no
 *      verified params preimage. Documented now so the number is reserved and a consumer can wire
 *      it; not claimed to fire.
 *   7  internal invariant violation — a (verdict, enrolment, settlement) tuple the rules cannot
 *      produce reached the exit mapper. A statement about THIS VERIFIER, never about the evidence.
 *
 * The JSON result carries two fields beyond the pre-settlement shape, both always present:
 * `enrolment` (was the enrolment question asked at all) and `dimensions.settlement`.
 *
 * The mapping itself lives in `exit-codes.ts`, not here, and it is DERIVED from the dimension rules
 * rather than authored beside them — see that file for why an exit table written separately from the
 * rules that feed it produced a branch nothing could reach.

   *
   *   • A BARE TRAILING FLAG consumed `undefined` and the run CONTINUED. An invocation ending in
   *     `--audience` verified with no reader identity and exited 0 — the operator typed a flag, got a
   *     verdict, and nothing said the flag did nothing.
   *   • A REPEATED FLAG was LAST-WINS, silently. Measured: `--audience hostile --audience good`
   *     exited 6 and `--audience good --audience hostile` exited 4, so whoever appends to the command
   *     line last decides the answer. That is the shape a wrapper script, a CI template or an
   *     injected argument exploits, and it applies to `--tenant-root` exactly as much as to
   *     `--audience`: appending a second trust root would silently replace the first.
   *
   * `--enrolment-registry` is deliberately NOT a singleton — a reader legitimately holds several —
   * and it APPENDS, so a second one can never discard the first. That is the whole distinction: a
   * repeatable flag accumulates, a singleton refuses.

   * ⚠ THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES, MEASURED, AND IT CROSSED THE USAGE/VERDICT BOUNDARY. The value was
   * `Number(...)`, which answers `NaN` for a malformed string and `Infinity` for `"1e400"`. Nothing
   * refused either: the call site further down carried a `Number.isFinite` guard that SILENTLY
   * OMITTED `maxAgeMs` when the conversion failed — restoring the PERMISSIVE 24-hour default. So on
   * one DENIED fixture:
   *
   *     --max-age-hours 0                        -> exit 3   (the freshness rule fires)
   *     --max-age-hours definitely-not-a-number  -> exit 0   (the rule is gone)
   *
   * A mistyped SAFETY option produced a positive verdict. `Number.isFinite` reading as a defence is
   * exactly the shape that hides one: it was true of the guard and false of the outcome, because
   * "the value is not finite" was answered by dropping the option rather than by refusing the run.
   *
   * The raw string is checked, not just the converted number, because `Number("")` is `0` and
   * `Number(" ")` is `0` — an empty value would otherwise become the STRICTEST setting by accident,
   * which is the same class of silent substitution in the other direction.
