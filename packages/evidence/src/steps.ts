 *   3. `paramsHash`          → the action that was approved (approve-A/execute-B defence, D14).
 *   4. `holdId`              → the hold envelope this evidence is about.

 * shipped gate cannot produce this artifact at all — `packages/gate/src/engine.ts:1265-1275` records
 * that after the C-04 fix no code path signs a determinate negative, and `:1296` signs `DISPATCHED`
 * as "the only outcome this method can still sign", so a conformant `EXECUTION_FAILED` bundle is
 * wire-verifiable and producer-unreachable today. Second, the residual is the reverse direction and
 * it is REAL: a party holding the gate key that wants to hide a dispatch may claim the failure
 * outcome, and this verifier cannot refute it offline. That is NC-2.1's own subject and it is not

 * S5 REVISION 3 — THE SETTLEMENT ARTIFACT PLANE (R1/R2/R3), run INSIDE step 10 AFTER every shipped
 * EXECUTED check, and ONLY when the bundle carries a settlement artifact (present ⇒ always checked,
 * §5.2 R0). It bridges to the shipped D7 reconciler; it invents no rule of its own.
 *
 * TWO GATES, IN THIS ORDER. First `verifyArtifact` authenticates the artifact itself — schema, the
 * observer Ed25519 signature, the F15 `settlement-observer` role, revocation. Then the shipped
 * reconciler runs S4 layers 4+6 over the bundle's own documents: the hash-verified params preimage
 * (R2), the offline bounds and the RECOMPUTED D7 correlation (R3), all under the reconciler's
 * derivation-provenance rule (chainId/token/payer come only from the verified preimage, never the
 * artifact). The reconciler authenticates NOTHING itself (its own R-12b), so the verifyArtifact gate
 * is load-bearing, not decorative — a positive reconciler result over an unsigned artifact is
 * meaningless.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SLICE DECIDES, AND WHAT IT LEAVES TO ENROLMENT. No enrolment registry exists in this
 * verifier, so the class is never ENROLLED. A VALID, bound, offline artifact therefore leaves the
 * settlement dimension at the pipeline-complete default `NO_EXECUTION_BINDING` (R-DIM-1's "unenrolled,
 * valid artifact" row) — it is NOT upgraded to `ATTESTED_UNVERIFIED` or `RECONFIRMED`, because nobody
 * asked and nobody re-queried. `chainFacts` (R9) is therefore never supplied here, so no online code
 * arises. What the plane DOES decide is the fail-closed half — a supplied-but-wrong preimage, an
 * out-of-bounds coordinate, a mis-recomputed correlation, a determinate non-settlement under EXECUTED,
