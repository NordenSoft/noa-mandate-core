/**
 * DESIGN 2 — the delegation/manifest validity window, and the two verdict dimensions.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. One word answered two questions that can legitimately disagree: "are these bytes
 * intact" (permanent) and "is this authority valid" (a policy window that closes). Collapsed, an
 * auditor reading a five-year-old bundle either sees INVALID for cryptographically perfect evidence
 * — and learns to ignore the verdict — or sees VALID for a trust chain that expired years ago, and
 * cannot tell whether acting on it is safe.
 *
 * THE RULE NOW. Both purposes require verifier-controlled `now` inside the root-signed delegation
 * and the manifest's own reject-only window. A caller may use a trusted historical `now`, but the
 * manifest's issuedAt and the dependent gate's receivedAt cannot supply it. Both purposes report
 * `dimensions.integrity`, `dimensions.authorization`, and `policy.verifierVersion`.
