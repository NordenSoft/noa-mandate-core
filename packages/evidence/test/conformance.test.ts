/**
 * §13 Evidence-Bundle conformance runner (the P1b-alpha DoD gate for D11-v2).
 *
 * Loads every generated fixture and asserts, for each:
 *   • the tiered VERDICT matches `expectVerdict`;
 *   • for a rejection/inconclusive/unverified fixture, the FAILING STEP + error CODE match
 *     `expectStep`/`expectCode` — i.e. the defect was caught at EXACTLY the layer that owns it. A
 *     wrong-layer catch (an earlier accidental step) is a conformance FAILURE, not a pass: that is
 *     the anti-cheat property the task requires.
 * Plus a coverage assertion: every one of the 8 outcomes has a VALID fixture, and every one of the
 * 20 named steps has ≥1 targeted rejection fixture.
