/**
 * The evidence package's half of the three review-#6 class mechanisms.
 *
 *  1. INTRINSIC POISONING — the same property the root suite asserts
 *     (`test/security/intrinsic-poisoning.test.ts`), applied to `verifyEvidence` over the WHOLE
 *     conformance corpus: no mutation of any shared intrinsic may make a verdict more permissive.
 *     This is where C1's first mechanism actually landed
 *     (`step19-role-allowed-verdict-executed.json`: INVALID / E_RECEIPT_ROLE -> VALID_FULL_CHAIN
 *     under a poisoned `Array.prototype.includes`), so the corpus is the right place to hold it.
 *
 *  2. POLICY TABLES ARE INERT BY CONSTRUCTION — walks EVERY exported value of the package and
 *     requires: nothing runtime-mutable is reachable (C3's `Set`s), nothing is unfrozen, and no array
 *     is rooted on the live `Array.prototype`. Glob-free and name-free: a table added to a NEW file
 *     tomorrow is covered, which is precisely what "fixed in one file only" was not.
 *
 *  3. ENTRY-POINT COVERAGE — every exported function is classified in the registry, and every
 *     function classified `ingests` is PROBED: its getters must fire at most once, and a hostile
 *     throw must not escape as a raw error. A new export cannot appear without a classification.
