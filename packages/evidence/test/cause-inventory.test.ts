/**
 * THE CAUSE INVENTORY — what the verifier CAN refuse, measured against what it DID refuse.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE GOT WRONG ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It scanned two files for the literal token `fail(`, treated each call site as a cause, and let a
 * cause be excused by a hand-written `UNREACHABLE` row. An adversarial reviewer took it apart in
 * four moves, and every one of them is now a test below:
 *
 *   1. `const hiddenRefusal = fail; hiddenRefusal(...)` — an ALIAS. Invisible to a text scan.
 *   2. A new cause routed through a HELPER that returns `fail(...)`. Invisible for the same reason,
 *      and not hypothetical: four distinct R8 causes already flow through one `required(reason)`
 *      call at `enrolment.ts`, so the old scan saw one cause where there are four.
 *   3. A refusal in a file that does not declare its own `fail` helper. Outside the scan entirely.
 *   4. The one that mattered. Step 14's missing-ALLOWED-receipt check was DECLARED unreachable by
 *      this file — falsely; the role chokepoint returns `receipt: null` rather than refusing, so a
 *      bundle without `allowedReceipt` reaches it. The reviewer kept the literal `fail(...)` inside
 *      an `if (false)` branch and returned ok. Cause inventory GREEN 7/7, evidence suite GREEN
 *      446/446, and a bundle missing its approval receipt verified as VALID_FULL_CHAIN.
 *
 * The root cause of all four is one mistake: coverage was decided from SOURCE TEXT. Text cannot tell
 * a live branch from a dead one, cannot follow a helper, and cannot see through a rename.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES NOW ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * COVERAGE IS DECIDED BY BEHAVIOUR. Every fixture in the corpus is run and every reason the verifier
 * ACTUALLY EMITTED is recorded. A cause is covered when the running verifier produced it. Nothing
 * else counts — a `fail(...)` no fixture can reach is ABSENT, not covered, whatever the source says
 * and whatever anyone declared about it.
 *
 * The source scan survives only to answer the other half of the question — WHAT COULD have been
 * emitted — and it is now written to be hard to hide from:
 *
 *   • every `src/*.ts` file, not a two-file allowlist;
 *   • REFUSAL PRODUCERS are found by fixed point, not by name: `fail`, anything aliased to it, and
 *     any function that returns a call to one. `required` is a producer, so its four call sites are
 *     four causes;
 *   • a producer call whose reason is its own caller's parameter is a FORWARD, not a cause — the
 *     causes are that wrapper's call sites, which is what makes the four R8 rows four rows;
 *   • and a refusal that cannot execute is a hard failure of its own, so the `if (false)` move is
 *     red before coverage is even considered.
 *
 * ── THE LEDGER IS DEBT, AND IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no longer an `UNREACHABLE` category, because "I reasoned that this cannot happen" is
 * exactly the claim that was false. Every cause the corpus does not produce is ABSENT: it is written
 * down, it is counted, and the set must match EXACTLY — a new one is red, and one that gains a
 * fixture must be deleted from the list. The list can only shrink.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated plainly: a cause on the ABSENT list can still be deleted or disabled without
 * turning anything red, because nothing exercises it. That is what being unmeasured MEANS. The list
 * is the honest count of it, and the dead-refusal rule below at least stops it being disabled in
 * place while still reading like a control.
