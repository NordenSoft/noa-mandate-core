/**
 * THE SETTLEMENT LADDER, AND THE EXIT TABLE DERIVED FROM IT.
 *
 * Four properties are pinned here, and they are pinned separately because they fail separately.
 * The process-level wire — that the shipped binary actually exits these numbers — is pinned in
 * `cli-wire.test.ts`, because a suite that only calls the mapper cannot see a CLI that ignores it.
 *
 * ── 1. THE EXIT CODE IS DERIVED, AND IT REFUSES WHAT THE RULES CANNOT PRODUCE ────────────────────
 *
 * The failure being designed out has a shape worth naming, because it is not "somebody wrote the
 * wrong number". An earlier draft of these rules authored the exit table in one section and the
 * dimension-assignment rules in another. Read alone each was reasonable. Composed, the exit's
 * trigger condition was one the dimension rules could never produce — so the branch existed, read in
 * review as a mitigation, and could not execute. A control that cannot fire is worse than a missing
 * one: it stops anyone looking for the real defence.
 *
 * The structural answer is that the assignment rules are the SOLE authority and the exit table adds
 * no case of its own. `RULE_ROWS` below is that authority written as data — every rule, the
 * `(enrolment, settlement)` pair it assigns, and the exit code the pair must produce. The test walks
 * the ROWS, not the branches.
 *
 * And for a tuple no row produces, the mapper THROWS rather than answering by verdict alone. That is
 * a correction forced by the counterexample: the earlier version answered `0` for every recognised positive
 * verdict before examining anything else, which fails OPEN at the money boundary for exactly the
 * inputs a defective rule delivers.
 *
 * ── WHAT `RULE_ROWS` DOES AND DOES NOT MEASURE, stated because the earlier version overstated it ─
 *
 * `RULE_ROWS` is hand-authored data. It pins the MAPPER against the rule table, and the `wired`
 * flags are asserted so that editing THIS TABLE is a visible edit rather than a silent one. It does
 * NOT read `verify-evidence.ts`, so by itself it cannot notice a new assignment path that no row
 * describes. What notices that is the corpus arm below (every shipped fixture's reported tuple), the
 * CLI wire test, and — for the case that matters most — the mapper's own refusal, which turns an
 * undescribed positive tuple into a loud non-zero exit instead of a silent `0`.
 *
 * Some rows are marked `wired: false`. Those rules are not built in this verifier; the row still
 * pins the exit contract their tuple must satisfy on the day they are. That is deliberate, and it is
 * why the exit function could be written correctly BEFORE the rules that feed it — the ordering the
 * earlier draft got backwards.
 *
 * ── 2. NOBODY ASKED, SO NOTHING MOVED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This verifier is not configured to evaluate action-class enrolment: there is no such input. So it
 * does not ask the settlement question, and it must not change a single answer it gave before the
 * question existed. The corpus arm re-derives every fixture's exit code with the pre-existing
 * mapping, written out verbatim, and requires the derived table to agree on every one — the whole
 * corpus, not a sample.
 *
 * ── 3. `purpose` DOES NOT TOUCH SETTLEMENT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An audit run and an authorization run examine the same settlement evidence — none — so they must
 * report the same settlement value and the same exit code. Pinned behaviourally, by running the
 * verifier both ways, because the corpus runner never passes `purpose` and a purpose-conditional
 * assignment would otherwise be invisible.
