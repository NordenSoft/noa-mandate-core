 * `sha256` instead, so it runs unmodified in a browser/webview/service-worker bundle. Both
 * produce standard FIPS 180-4 SHA-256 — there is no algorithmic difference to mirror, only the
 * driver changes. (Cross-checked ad hoc against the standard `sha256("abc")` test vector while

 * hash agrees with the upstream `node:crypto` implementation on real receipt bytes.)

// ── #77-A (2026-07-31): CAPTURED AT MODULE LOAD ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `encoder.encode(...)` went through `TextEncoder.prototype.encode`, a writable global — and this
// function decides WHAT GETS HASHED, hence what every signature covers. MEASURED against the
// pre-fix source: with `encode` returning an empty array, two different receipts produced the same
// signature. Captured here and dispatched through a captured `Reflect.apply`.
//
// SCOPE, stated so this is not read as more than it is (see deep-copy.ts's matching note): capture
// defends against POST-load mutation only. Code that runs before this module is evaluated captures
// the attacker's function instead. That is the same bound the root package's threat model states.

/**
 * KNOWN-ANSWER TEST for the SHA-256 primitive itself, run on every signing call.
 *
 * ── #77-A, THE PART I CANNOT FIX BY EDITING THIS PACKAGE ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Hardening `signing.ts` to assemble its message by index closed this package's OWN use of
 * `Uint8Array.prototype.set` — and the attack still worked. MEASURED, by tracing who else calls it:
 *
 *     at _SHA256.update (@noble/hashes/_md.js:94:20)
 *
 * The hash primitive's internals use `.set()`. With it poisoned, `sha256Bytes("A")` and
 * `sha256Bytes("B")` return the SAME digest — SHA-256 is neutralised beneath us, and every receipt
 * commits to the same value. No edit to this package can prevent that: the sink is inside a
 * dependency, and forking a vendored crypto library to remove one method call would be a far worse
 * trade than the defect.
 *
 * So this is DETECTION, not prevention, and it is named that way deliberately. Before a signature
 * is produced, the primitive must still reproduce the FIPS 180-4 vector for "abc". A neutralised or
 * constant-returning hash fails it immediately and the signing path throws instead of emitting a
 * receipt whose digest means nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A DETECTION BARRIER, NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY (CORRECTIONS.md C-6). Two poisons pass
 * it, and both are in the same threat model the rest of this package is written against:
 *   - SIZE-SELECTIVE: a poison that leaves the 3-byte "abc" vector intact while neutralising the
 *     sizes real receipts produce.
 *   - PRE-LOAD: a poison installed before this module is evaluated is captured INTO the bindings
 *     below, including this check's own — it would then validate the attacker's primitive against
 *     the attacker's arithmetic.
 * So it raises the cost of a same-realm attack and makes the common case fail closed. It does NOT
 * make this package resistant to a compromised cryptographic primitive inside its own process, and
 * no such claim should be made or inferred from it. FULL CLOSURE REQUIRES PROCESS ISOLATION OR AN
 * INDEPENDENTLY TRUSTED CRYPTOGRAPHIC BOUNDARY — neither of which a library in the same realm can
 * provide. Cost is one 3-byte SHA-256 per signature — negligible beside Ed25519.
