 *
 * Uses `@noble/curves/ed25519` as the signing driver (the primary driver per the parent build
 * spec §3 — deterministic and timing-consistent across every JS engine, unlike a platform's
 * native WebCrypto Ed25519, which this package does not use for signing at all). The produced
 * `sig.value` is BYTE-IDENTICAL to what `noa-receipt`'s own
 * `signEd25519(privateKey, signingMessage(RECEIPT_SIG_DOMAIN, receiptHashInput(receipt)))`
 * would produce for the same `core` + the same private key — see this package's G1 (RFC 8032
 * vectors) and G2 (golden-receipt parity) tests, the kill-gates this function must pass before
 * any consumer of this package ships.
 *
 * Returns a NEW `Receipt` (the input `core` is not mutated). One accessor-free inert snapshot is
 * taken before validation; that same snapshot is hashed, signed, and returned with `sig.value`, so
 * no second caller traversal can make the signed document differ from the returned document.
