/**
 * Domain-separated signing preimage — ported from `noa-receipt/src/signing.ts`.
 *
 * We do NOT sign the raw 32-byte SHA-256 digest directly: a bare Ed25519 signature over an
 * untagged 32-byte value invites cross-protocol signature reuse (the same key signing a
 * 32-byte value in some other context produces a value an attacker could replay here). So the
 * signed message is `<domain-tag>:` ++ digest, where the tag pins the artifact kind and the
 * spec version. This is the literal constant from upstream, copied not re-derived — a typo
 * here would silently produce a signature `verifyChain` rejects as MALFORMED/TAMPERED, so any
 * mismatch is caught immediately by this package's G2 golden-parity test, not just by review.

 * What stood here was:
 *     out.set(domainBytes, 0);
 *     out.set(digest, domainBytes.length);
 * `Uint8Array.prototype.set` is a WRITABLE GLOBAL. Replace it with a no-op and `out` stays all
 * zeroes — so the "domain-separated message" becomes a CONSTANT, identical for every receipt, with
 * neither the tag nor the digest in it. MEASURED against the pre-fix source:
 *     sig("infra.deploy") === sig("production.delete.all")   and the message was 53 zero bytes.
 * That is the total loss of the property this function exists to provide: that a signature is a
 * function of the receipt it covers.
 *
 * Integer-indexed writes on a typed array are handled by the exotic object's own internal method
 * and do NOT consult the prototype chain for a setter — measured separately on `bytes.ts`, where an
 * accessor installed on `Uint8Array.prototype["0"]` never fired. So the loops below cannot be
 * intercepted the way `.set()` could.
