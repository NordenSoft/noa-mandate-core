/**
 * RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme) — hardened for NOA Receipts.
 *
 * PORTED BYTE-FOR-BYTE from `noa-receipt/src/jcs.ts` (verified identical algorithm at the time
 * of writing; see this package's G2 golden-parity test, which asserts this file's output is
 * byte-identical to the upstream one for the same receipt input, not just "looks the same").
 * The upstream file has zero Node-specific imports itself (pure string/array operations), so
 * this copy is a genuine 1:1 mirror, not a reimplementation from a spec description — see
 * README.md "Why a copy, not an import" for why this package does not import the upstream
 * module directly at runtime.
 *
 * Why hardened: the canonical byte-form is the input to the hash. ANY producer/verifier
 * disagreement on those bytes is a silent forgery channel. So this implementation is
 * deliberately STRICT and SMALL:
 *   - floats / non-finite / unsafe-integer numbers are REJECTED (receipts use integers only;
 *     this removes ECMAScript number-serialization ambiguity entirely);
 *   - object keys sorted by UTF-16 code units (JS default string sort — matches RFC 8785);
 *   - strings escaped per RFC 8785 (control chars escaped, all other code points emitted
 *     literally as UTF-8 — NO \u-escaping of non-control characters, NO Unicode normalization);
 *   - undefined / functions / symbols / bigint are REJECTED.
 *
 * Inputs MUST already be NFC-normalized by the producer; this layer does not normalize
 * (normalizing here would mask producer/verifier disagreement instead of surfacing it).

// The root package hardened its own `src/jcs.ts` this way in round 2 (`arraySort(objectKeys(obj))`).
// signer-core is an INDEPENDENT COPY that never received it, and the file's own docstring says why
// that matters: "a rule enforced in one of two producers is not an invariant, it is a coincidence."
//
// MEASURED against the pre-fix source, each with a live control and clean restoration:
//   Array.prototype.sort -> empties      {a:1,b:2} and {x:"production.delete.all"} BOTH -> "{}"
//   Array.prototype.sort -> identity     the SAME document in two key orders -> TWO canonical forms
//   Object.keys          -> []           fields vanish from the commitment
//   String.prototype.isWellFormed -> true  U+D800 and U+D801 both encode to 7b2273223a22efbfbd227d
//                                          (2048 code points into ONE hash bucket — the exact
//                                           forgery channel serializeString's comment describes)
//
// Dispatched through a captured `Reflect.apply` so the calls do not go back out through a live
// `.call`/`.apply`. SCOPE (same bound as hash.ts and deep-copy.ts): capture defends against
// POST-load mutation only; a pre-load poison is captured INTO these bindings.
