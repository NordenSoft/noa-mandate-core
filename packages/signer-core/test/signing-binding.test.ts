/**
 * #77-A — THE SIGNATURE MUST BE A FUNCTION OF THE RECEIPT, AND OF NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 * ─── THE DEFECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `signingMessageBytes` assembled the exact Ed25519 message with two LIVE inherited method calls:
 *
 *     const out = new Uint8Array(domainBytes.length + digest.length);
 *     out.set(domainBytes, 0);              // Uint8Array.prototype.set — writable, global
 *     out.set(digest, domainBytes.length);  // same
 *
 * `Uint8Array.prototype.set` is a writable slot. Replace it with a no-op and `out` stays all
 * zeroes, so the "message" is a CONSTANT: the domain tag is gone and the receipt digest is gone.
 * MEASURED against the pre-fix source, with a live control in the same run:
 *
 *     CONTROL  two different receipts -> different signatures        (content-bound)
 *     ATTACK   sig("infra.deploy")          = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…
 *              sig("production.delete.all") = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…   IDENTICAL
 *              signed message = 00000000…00  (53 zero bytes: tag AND digest both absent)
 *     POST     restored -> different again
 *
 * A second sink in the same family reaches the same outcome one file over: `hash.ts` builds what
 * gets hashed with `encoder.encode(...)`, and `TextEncoder.prototype.encode` is equally live.
 *
 * ─── ATTACKER · VICTIM · CAPABILITY · OUTCOME ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   attacker    any code running in the same realm BEFORE the signing call — a dependency earlier
 *               in the import graph, or anything that has already achieved script execution
 *   victim      the tenant whose approval evidence is being produced
 *   capability  prototype pollution ONLY. No key material, no network position, no signature forgery
 *   outcome     one signature covers every document. The binding between a signature and the action
 *               it authorises is destroyed at the producer
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE, stated because overstating it is a defect in itself (CORRECTIONS.md C-5): a receipt
 * produced under this poison FAILS CLOSED at a clean verifier — the constant message does not match
 * the digest a clean verifier computes. The realised harm is (a) a producer that emits garbage
 * evidence for real approvals, and (b) a verifier running in the SAME poisoned realm, which accepts
 * anything. It is not a path to a forged approval accepted by an honest remote verifier.
 *
 * ─── WHY INDEX WRITES ARE THE FIX ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A typed array's integer-indexed writes are handled by the exotic object's own internal method and
 * do NOT consult the prototype chain for a setter. MEASURED separately: with an accessor installed
 * on `Uint8Array.prototype["0"]`, `hexToBytes` was unaffected and the setter fired 0 times.
