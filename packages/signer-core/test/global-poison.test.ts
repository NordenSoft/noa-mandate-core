/**
 * C-01 SIBLING — PERMANENT REGRESSION. The receipt pre-image must not be built through a writable
 * global.
 *
 * THE DEFECT: `receiptHashInput` was `structuredClone(receipt)` plus two `delete`s.
 * `structuredClone` is a writable global. The root package measured what that costs and recorded
 * the reproduction in `src/canonicalize.ts`:
 *
 *     globalThis.structuredClone = () => genuineReceipt;
 *     verifyChain(bytesOfForgedReceipt, { keyring })   // => VALID
 *
 * The root then closed its OWN sink and left this one — the sibling — in place. The existing
 * exploit fixture missed it because its poison was shaped for the old sink.
 *
 * THIS SINK SITS ON BOTH SIDES, which is why it is worse than the root's was: the relay's only
 * cryptographic check reaches it through `relay/src/crypto.ts`, and this package's own `sign()`
 * reaches it when PRODUCING a receipt. Poisoned on the producer side, the signature would cover
 * bytes the returned receipt does not contain.
