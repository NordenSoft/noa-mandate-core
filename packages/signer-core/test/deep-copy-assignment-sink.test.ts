/**
 * R8-15 — PERMANENT REGRESSION. `inertDeepCopy` must never build its output by ASSIGNMENT.
 *
 * ─── THE DEFECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `deep-copy.ts` wrote every key with `out[key] = copyValue(...)` onto a PLAIN `{}`, and argued in a
 * comment that prototype pollution could not reach it because inherited properties are never READ.
 * That is true about reads and it is the wrong half of the problem: on a plain object, assignment
 * CONSULTS THE PROTOTYPE CHAIN FOR A SETTER, and `Object.prototype` ships exactly one —
 * `__proto__`. So `out["__proto__"] = v` is not a property write at all; it RE-PARENTS `out` and
 * stores nothing.
 *
 * No poison, no Proxy and no accessor is needed to reach it. `JSON.parse` produces an ORDINARY OWN
 * `__proto__` data property — which is precisely how untrusted input arrives at a signing path.
 *
 * ─── WHY IT IS A SIGNING DEFECT AND NOT A CURIOSITY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `signReceipt` computes `receiptHashInput(core)` — the bytes the Ed25519 signature covers — and
 * separately returns `inertDeepCopy(core)`. `receiptHashInput` builds onto a NULL-prototype object,
 * where there is no inherited setter, so it KEEPS an own `__proto__`. The deep copy DROPPED it.
 * Two different documents, one signature: the exact forgery shape this package's own module
 * docstring says it exists to make impossible, reached without touching a single global.
 *
 * The value also survives the round trip as a phantom — `copy.governance.approval` READS BACK as an
 * approval while being neither an own property nor present in the JSON that goes on the wire. A
 * consumer checking `if (receipt.governance.approval)` sees a human approval that the signature does
 * not cover and that no auditor re-reading the bytes will ever find.
 *
 * ─── WHY `defineProperty` AND NOT A BLACKLIST ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured, not argued. `structuredClone` — the behaviour `inertDeepCopy` replaced and must
 * reproduce — keeps an own `__proto__` as an ORDINARY OWN PROPERTY and leaves the prototype alone.
 * Rejecting or dropping the key would diverge from it and break the G2 golden-parity contract,
 * while `defineProperty` matches it exactly. It also generalises: a blacklist closes one spelling,
 * whereas defining every key closes the entire class, including any inherited setter a future
 * runtime or a polyfilled `Object.prototype` might add under a name nobody has thought of yet.
 *
 * The tests below therefore do NOT stop at `__proto__`. They cover it at nesting depth, inside an
 * array, and alongside every other `Object.prototype` member name, because a fix that only knew one
 * string would pass a one-string test.
 *
 * ─── HOW THE FIXTURES ARE BUILT, AND WHY IT MATTERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A TypeScript/JavaScript object literal `{ "__proto__": x }` is SPECIAL-CASED by the language: it
 * sets the prototype instead of creating an own property, so a fixture written that way would test
 * nothing. Every hostile fixture here is built with `JSON.parse` or `Object.defineProperty`, and
 * `assertOwnProtoVehicleIsLive` re-proves on every run that the fixture really carries the own key
 * AND that assignment really re-parents in this runtime. A test whose attack input silently stopped
 * being hostile is worse than no test.
