/**
 * G1 — RFC 8032 vector parity gate (parent build spec §3 "PARITY GATES", kill-gate #1).
 *
 * Signs RFC 8032 §7.1 TEST 1/2/3 with `@noble/curves/ed25519` (this package's signing driver)
 * and asserts the produced public key AND signature are byte-identical to the RFC's own
 * published vectors — not "looks right", the literal expected hex. A mismatch here means the
 * signing driver itself has diverged from the spec noa-receipt's own node:crypto path also
 * implements, which would silently break every downstream receipt this package ever signs.
 *
 * `rfc8032-vectors.ts` is copied byte-for-byte from an earlier internal probe of the same
 * vectors, which is not published. That does not weaken the gate: the vectors' authority is
 * RFC 8032 §7.1 itself, `rfc8032-vectors.ts` documents its own RFC provenance in-file, and it
 * was cross-checked independently against `@noble/curves@2.2.0` before it was written.
