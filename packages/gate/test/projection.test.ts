/** ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" A DRIFT HERE — ADR-0006-A part A changed what these vectors MEAN.
 *
 *  The identity now commits to the adapter's EMITTED IMPLEMENTATION ARTIFACT, not to `{id, version,
 *  kind}`. So there are exactly TWO legitimate causes of drift, and they need opposite responses:
 *
 *    1. `run()` CHANGED. The vector is doing its job. Re-derive it, and say in the commit what
 *       behaviour changed — every previously-signed envelope now pins a superseded identity.
 *    2. THE TOOLCHAIN CHANGED (a tsc upgrade, a tsconfig target/emit change) with no behaviour
 *       change. The artifact genuinely differs, so the identity genuinely differs. Re-derive it and
 *       say THAT — otherwise the next reader reads cause 2 as cause 1 and hunts a behaviour change
 *       that never happened.
 *
 *  What is NEVER a legitimate response is deleting the assertion. An unpinned identity catches
 *  nothing, and "the hash moved" is the only signal that an adapter was swapped.
 *
 *  Normalizing the source text before hashing — to make cause 2 stop happening — was considered and
 *  REFUSED: an equivalence class is an ATTACKER'S CHOICE OF REPRESENTATIVE, and the normalizer is new
 *  attack surface inside the TCB whose bugs would be identity forgeries. A rare, diagnosable drift is
 *  the cheaper failure. */
