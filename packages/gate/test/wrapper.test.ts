/** BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, 2026-07-30 (owner digest decision) — STRICTER, NOT WEAKENED.
 *
 *  This test used to assert `422 PARAMS_HASH_MISMATCH`: a caller COULD supply `action.paramsHash`, and
 *  it was rejected only when it DISAGREED with the gate's own. The field is now refused outright with
 *  `422 PARAMS_HASH_NOT_CALLER_SUPPLIED`, matching or not, because accepting the field is the defect —
 *  a value accepted today because it matches is accepted tomorrow when it does not, and the equality
 *  check that caught it is one reordering away from being bypassed.
 *
 *  The assertion is updated, NOT relaxed: the request is still refused with 422, and now on a strictly
 *  larger set of inputs. `PARAMS_HASH_MISMATCH` no longer exists anywhere in the source. */

//
// `params` are snapshotted immutably at entry (wrapper.ts:161, `structuredClone`). `execute` was NOT:
// it was read LIVE at dispatch, ~85 lines and one human decision later. Between those two points the
// gate posts a hold, a person reads a rendered command and approves it, the hold resolution is signed
// and a grant is RESERVED — and only THEN does the gate look up the function to call, on an object
// the caller still owns.
//
// So the approved command and the executed command were never the same object. The gate then signs an
// ExecutionConsumption saying DISPATCHED, which a relying party reads as evidence that the approved
// command ran. wrapper.ts:5-10 claims exactly that binding.
//
// Nothing untrusted is needed: the party supplying `execute` also supplies `params`. But this is a
// CALLER-OWNED VALUE READ INSIDE THE TRUSTED PATH AFTER AUTHENTICATION — the defect class this branch
// was written to eliminate, surviving at the last node.
