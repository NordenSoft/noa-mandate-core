/**
 * THE AUTHORITY ROOT, UNDER A FULLY COMPROMISED GATE PROCESS.
 *
 * `NON-CLAIMS.md` carried this defect verbatim: the grant-signing key was a base64 string in the
 * gate's own Node process, so *"the same ambient attacker who motivates this entire architecture can
 * read that key from process memory and mint grants that are cryptographically indistinguishable
 * from genuine ones."* This file is the measurement that the split closes it, and the measurement of
 * exactly where it stops closing it.
 *
 * ── THE ATTACKER MODELLED HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything the gate process has: every private key on its heap (the gate's `hold-signer` /
 * receipt key), the store, the trust root, the socket path and the client shim — plus arbitrary
 * code. It may call the signer directly, off the engine's path, with any bytes it likes. What it
 * does NOT have is the APPROVER's device key: that is on the phone, and a gate that holds it has no
 * approval boundary to defend in the first place. The final test measures that boundary rather than
 * assuming it — an attacker who also holds the approver key DOES get a grant, and that is stated as
 * a precondition, not hidden as an assumption.
 *
 * A test that only proved "the key is not in this variable" would prove nothing. Every refusal below
 * is a real request to a real sidecar process over a real socket, and the anti-vacuity control — an
 * honest approval getting a real, manifest-verifiable grant through the same socket in the same run
 * — is asserted alongside them.
