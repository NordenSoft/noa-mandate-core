/**
 * KEYRING RESOLVER PARITY — the test P0-7 claimed existed, now actually written (2026-07-31).
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A comment in `src/trust.ts` asserted that "the parity test added with this change is what makes
 * a fourth [resolver] fail loudly instead of silently". No such test existed —
 * `grep -rn "parity" packages/gate/test/` returned nothing, and deleting all four keyring
 * `validFrom` properties left every then-existing test GREEN. That claim is withdrawn in place
 * (see src/trust.ts); THIS file is the real control, and it is registered in
 * `scripts/resolver-inventory.json` so `scripts/lint-resolver-parity.mjs` fails if it is removed,
 * skipped or stops resolving.
 *
 * ─── WHAT IT PROVES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. CARRIAGE — every activation/revocation value DECLARED in the alpha Key Manifest (and the
 *    root delegation) survives into the LIVE keyring `engine.ts` verifies Decisions against.
 *    Deleting `validFrom` from any keyring entry in `createAlphaTrust` turns this RED.
 * 2. OFFLINE-CONSUMER ENFORCEMENT — through the resolver's own output, a decision dated before
 *    the approver's activation is REFUSED by `verifyArtifact` (the §13/offline shape, artifact
 *    time from `decidedAt`). Also RED if the resolver drops `validFrom`.
 * 3. LIVE-ENGINE ENFORCEMENT — a future-activated approver (the injected-`GateTrust` exposure
 *    P0-5 recorded: `createGate` accepts an injected trust) cannot mint a grant: the engine's
 *    authorization-time check refuses with "before its validFrom".
 *
 * Proof ID referenced by scripts/resolver-inventory.json — do not rename without updating it:
 *   [PROOF:RES-PAR-GATE-KEYRING]
