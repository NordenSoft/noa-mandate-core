/**
 * The grant-nonce format tripwire at the trust boundary (added 2026-08-13).
 *
 * `nonces` is a public `CreateTrustInput` member and `localExecutionSigner` performs no post-sign
 * schema self-check, so before this guard an injected `() => "zz"` source minted gate-signed grants
 * that failed their own schema only downstream — and `() => "00".repeat(32)` would mint schema-valid
 * constant-nonce grants silently. Format is validated on EVERY draw (a construction-time probe draw
 * would shift injected deterministic sequences); entropy remains unenforceable at this boundary and
 * is deliberately not claimed.
