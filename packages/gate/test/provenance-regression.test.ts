/**
 * PERMANENT SECURITY REGRESSION SUITE — trusted-input provenance.
 *
 * Every test here encodes an attack that was INDEPENDENTLY REPRODUCED against this package before a
 * line of the fix was written (`docs/GATE-PROVENANCE-FINDINGS-2026-07-30.md`). Each asserts the
 * SECURE outcome, so on the pre-fix tree this suite is expected to be RED. That is the point: these
 * are the acceptance gate for ADR-0005, and restoring any vulnerable behaviour must turn them RED
 * again.
 *
 * RULES THIS FILE OBEYS (owner instruction, 2026-07-30 Phase 2):
 *   1. Test the SECURITY OUTCOME, never the implementation's internal structure. A test asserting
 *      "the code calls parseDocument()" would pass a refactor that reintroduced the hole.
 *   2. Every attack has an ANTI-VACUITY CONTROL in the same run — the honest path must still work.
 *      A suite where everything is refused is indistinguishable from a broken fixture, and this
 *      project has twice read an unfailable run as a passing one.
 *   3. Where an attack depends on a value being read twice, assert on the OBSERVABLE DECISION, not
 *      on a read count. Read counts are an implementation detail; a signed HUMAN_APPROVED on a
 *      denied action is a defect under any implementation.
 *   4. Prove the poison FIRED. Zero reads means the fixture changed, not the gate — that is an
 *      inconclusive run, never a pass.

 *  It passed because `engine.ts:469` cross-checks the artifact's decision against the receipt's
 *  `governance.verdict`, and flipping one without the other is caught. The working attack flips BOTH,
 *  in OPPOSITE directions, because the two fields are read in opposite orders relative to their

 *  ported from the harness that actually reproduces it. */

 *  mode from the projection registry (a caller cannot select it), and `:322-328` then returns 422 for
 *  RAW UNCONDITIONALLY — the B-1 migration clause. Its own comment states the conclusion: *"it is no

 *  and never reached, because the hold does not exist.
 *
 *  A RAW branch would therefore be UNCONSTRUCTIBLE: no path produces it, no test exercises it, no
 *  knockout measures it — the exact shape `wrapper.ts` records DELETING two of, with the lesson that
 *  unreachable code inside the TCB is a comfort blanket, not a control.
 *
 *  This test is the anti-vacuity control for that omission. It makes "there is no RAW branch" a
 *  MEASURED fact rather than an inference.
 *
 *  ⚠ IF THIS GOES RED BECAUSE RAW HOLD CREATION WAS RE-OPENED, DO NOT UPDATE THE ASSERTION.
