/** BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, 2026-07-30 (owner decision B-1's migration clause, now implemented) —
 *  CONVERTED, NOT DELETED.
 *
 *  This test used to assert that RAW mode SUCCEEDS with 201: an unregistered action, a caller-supplied
 *  `paramsHash` and a caller-authored `display`, labelled RAW with a null projection.
 *
 *  B-1 states verbatim: "An unmatched action must classify to the HIGHEST tier and fail closed —
 *  otherwise the default is the vulnerability." The old code tested only the CALLER's `riskClass` and
 *  refused when the caller VOLUNTEERED CRITICAL/IRREVERSIBLE, so the fail-closed branch was reachable
 *  only by an honest caller. This request — `riskClass: "MEDIUM"` on an unregistered action — walked
 *  straight past it, and `effectiveRisk` then defaulted to that same hint. Since
 *  `verify.ts:133-138` turns `riskClass` into `requiredApproverRole`, the caller was choosing its own
 *  approver tier on precisely the path with no derivation to check it against.
 *
 *  The assertion is INVERTED, not relaxed: the same request that used to get a 201 now gets a 422, so
 *  the refused set is strictly larger. RAW remains what its own comment always claimed — diagnostic,
 *  never authorization — but it is no longer a hold-creation path. The `mode`/`actionSchema`/
 *  `displayProjection` envelope shape this test used to pin is now unreachable through a caller and is
 *  covered for the ENFORCED path by the tests above. */
