/**
 * C4 AT THE GATE, AS ONE INVARIANT OVER EVERY TOOL BEHAVIOUR:
 *
 *     if `input.execute()` was INVOKED, `guard()` never reports a retry-safe outcome.
 *
 * "Retry-safe" is precisely what a caller reads off the result: `ran === false`, or a `result` the
 * gate signs as `FAILED_BEFORE_DISPATCH` (which the side-effect reducer classifies `safeToRetry`).
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE. Review #5 fixed the bare-throw case and review #6 walked in through the marked
 * throw and the `{ ok: false }` return — the same class, two more mechanisms. A test per mechanism
 * would have caught neither in advance. This one enumerates the tool's ENTIRE observable vocabulary
 * (return true / return false / throw anything at all, including a forged proof) and asserts the
 * invariant for every member, so a seventh mechanism has nowhere to land.
 *
 * The complementary half is asserted too, and matters just as much: every path that does NOT invoke
 * `execute()` — deny, expiry, cancellation, a params mismatch, a lost reserve race, uncloneable
 * params — must STILL report `ran:false`. An over-correction that made every refusal look like an
 * unknown would be its own defect: it would teach operators that UNKNOWN means nothing.
