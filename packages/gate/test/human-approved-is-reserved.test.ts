/**
 * `HUMAN_APPROVED` IS RESERVED, AND NOTHING MAY PRODUCE IT UNTIL THE THIRD LEG HAS A SOURCE.
 *
 * ─── THE RULE IS THE OWNER'S, NOT AN ADR'S ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `NON-CLAIMS.md` (amended by the owner 2026-07-29, with the surrounding consequences marked
 * owner-ratified and binding):
 *
 *     approval_intent_digest == grant_intent_digest == execution_intent_digest
 *     No component may claim `HUMAN_APPROVED` unless that equality has been independently
 *     established.
 *
 * TWO of the three legs are established at the gate: the boundary derives the display, the action
 * binding holds, the approver's identity and timing window are checked, the decision is bound to
 * THIS hold, and the grant is taken from `hold.action.paramsHash`. The THIRD — that the target ran
 * those params — has no admissible source. Stages 9-10 accept no input a gate can verify, `NC-6.8`
 * declined credential custody, and no cooperating third party exists.
 *
 * So until an execution witness exists, emitting `HUMAN_APPROVED` is claiming an equality nobody
 * established. The ENFORCED path emits `HUMAN_APPROVED_INTENT_NOT_EXECUTION_BOUND`, which says less
 * and is true.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE WAS REBUILT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The previous version of this control was a per-line regular expression over source text, and it
 * stated its own limit in its own docstring:
 *
 *     "It proves no code SAYS the token, not that no code could compute it. A computed
 *      `HUMAN_ + APPROVED` would pass. That is accepted — the realistic regression is a literal."
 *
 * That estimate was wrong, and not by a little. THIRTY-SEVEN distinct emissions were measured passing
 * it green — every one of them executed and observed returning the token — plus TEN conditions it
 * could not detect at all. The four shapes it did catch are the only four it ever could:
 *
 *   A — the SAME STRING, SPELLED DIFFERENTLY. It matched the eleven bytes `"HUMAN_APPROVED"`, so a
 *       single-quoted literal, a backtick literal, a `+`, an escape, a `String.fromCharCode`, a
 *       base64 `Buffer.from` and an `Array#join` all walked past.
 *   B — AN EMISSION SHAPE IT DID NOT RECOGNISE. It also required `reasonCode:` or `= ` on the SAME
 *       LINE, so an object map under any other key, an array element, a `return`, a call argument —
 *       or simply putting the value on the next line — were invisible. A line-based matcher cannot
 *       see a value that wraps.
 *   C — ITS COMMENT FILTER APPLIED TO REAL CODE. It skipped any line whose first characters were
 *       `*`, `//` or `|`, meaning to skip doc comments and the type union. `x\n  || "HUMAN_APPROVED"`
 *       begins with `|`, so a live emission was skipped as if it were a type.
 *   D — FILES THE WALK NEVER REACHED. It took `.ts` under two hardcoded directories. A `.json`
 *       beside the code compiles under this package's own `resolveJsonModule`, ships in `dist/src`,
 *       and returns the token at runtime — measured. Everything in the ten other source roots,
 *       including `packages/approval-artifacts/src`, was outside its world entirely.
 *   E — ANYTHING IT COULD NOT READ PASSED. It never parsed, so nothing could fail to parse.
 *
 * The rebuilt control asks the question the rule actually asks — what does this program PRODUCE —
 * by folding value-position expressions with the TypeScript compiler API (`test/lib/reserved-token.ts`).
 * Its load-bearing property is the opposite of its predecessor's: A FILE IT CANNOT ANALYSE FAILS.
 *
 * ─── AND THEN THE REBUILD MADE THE SAME MISTAKE ONE LEVEL DOWN ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An independent adversarial review of the first rebuild found ten MORE emissions, class G below.
 * Every one was a constant-only program — no network, no undecidable loop — and every one scored
 * zero findings. The diagnosis was not ten bugs:
 *
 *     unresolved calls and data flow returned `unknown`, and the material check only looked INSIDE
 *     the unfoldable expression. So `unknown` was the same answer as "no token here".
 *
 * Split the pieces across two statements — or two modules — and both halves went quiet. That is the
 * defect this control exists to correct, committed by the control. The fix is not ten patches: the
 * fold now evaluates functions defined in the scanned set, resolves `default` exports, and reads
 * regex replaces and object builders; and where it still cannot decide, the material question is
 * asked at the level the material actually lives — every constant a module and its imports can
 * reach, and whether the token can be BUILT from them.
 *
 * ─── AND WHY THE FIXTURES BELOW ARE THE POINT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The retired control had one probe proving it could see one shape. It passed for months while
 * thirty-seven emissions would have walked past it, because "the control is green" and "the control
 * can go red" are different claims. Every bypass listed above is a fixture here, and each one is
 * asserted THREE ways: the retired matcher is green on it (it was a real hole), the rebuilt control
 * is red on it (the hole is closed), and — where the fixture is executable — it really does return
 * the token at runtime (it was never a straw man).
