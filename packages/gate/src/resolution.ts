/**
 * NOA Gate — the gate-signed Hold Resolution (F10, §8).
 *
 * Emitted for EVERY terminal outcome (APPROVED/DENIED/EXPIRED/CANCELLED) at the instant the gate
 * accepts the terminal state. It carries the gate's OWN trusted `receivedAt` — the verifier's
 * authorization-time source of truth, NEVER the phone-written `decidedAt` (a revoked/compromised
 * approver key could backdate `decidedAt` past its own revocation). Signed by the gate
 * `execution-signer` under `NOA-HoldResolution-v0.1-sig`.
