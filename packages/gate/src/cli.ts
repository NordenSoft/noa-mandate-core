/**
 * noa-gate CLI (spec §8). Two subcommands:
 *
 *   noa-gate serve                 boot an alpha dev gate (loopback-by-default, D20) and print creds.
 *   noa-gate hold-and-run ...      the exact-execution wrapper (D3/D14): freeze a command as a hold,
 *                                  wait for the human, reserve the grant, run the command, report.
 *                                  Exits 0 ONLY on EXECUTED; fail-closed non-zero on
 *                                  deny/expire/timeout/refusal/error (never runs an unapproved cmd).
 *
 * The dev `serve` wires NO HPKE display sealer (fail-closed on a RAW plaintext display; the gate
 * never ships plaintext and never fakes encryption). A real deployment injects @noa/signer's sealer.

  // the one you have to type out. That order is deliberate and it is a correction: the first cut
  // shipped the in-process grant key as the silent default, which meant the posture NON-CLAIMS.md
  // calls the defect was what an operator got by saying nothing (adversarial review 2026-08-12).
  //
  // Three env vars, not one, and the two extra ones are the whole fix for two more findings:
  //   *_SIGNER_KID / *_SIGNER_PUBLIC_KEY — the signer's identity, from the OPERATOR. Asking the
  //     socket who it is and then minting a manifest naming that answer let anyone who could
  //     replace the listener publish themselves as the tenant's execution-signer.
  //   *_APPROVER_KID / *_APPROVER_PUBLIC_KEY / *_APPROVER_HPKE_PUBLIC_KEY — the phone's enrolled
  //     public half. Without it `createAlphaTrust` would GENERATE the approver key here, leaving
  //     the one signature the sidecar relies on inside the process it is defending against.
