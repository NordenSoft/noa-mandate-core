/**
 * noa-gate — the NOA generic HTTP gate + exact-execution wrapper (spec §8, the THIRD door).
 *
 * The TRUSTED SIGNER half of the approval protocol (the opposite boundary from the relay, which
 * never signs). The gate mints every gate-side signed artifact — Hold Envelope (D1), Execution
 * Grant (D13), Consumption, Execution Uncertainty (F8c), Hold Resolution (F10) and the POLICY-signed
 * timeout receipt (D19) — and owns the AUTHORITATIVE atomic single-use grant record (F8a). It binds
 * the exact execution (D3/D14/D18): a params-hash mismatch REFUSES to run. Loopback-by-default (D20).
