 * NOA Gate — trust bootstrap (alpha-simplified, F21/F11).
 *
 * The gate holds ONE Ed25519 signing key that is typed GATE in the manifest with BOTH roles
 * `hold-signer` (Hold Envelope, D1) and `execution-signer` (Grant / Consumption / Uncertainty /
 * Hold Resolution). The SAME key also signs the DEFERRED/EXECUTED/FAILED/timeout RECEIPTS under the

 * the Key Manifest — that is signed by the tenant authority (the delegated manifest signer, F21),
 * whose delegation is signed by an offline root.
 *
 * Alpha (F21): a SINGLE static tenant-authority-signed manifest + one static root→authority
 * delegation, so the §6 signing hierarchy (root → delegated signer → gate/approver/audit keys) is
 * satisfiable even before beta's full offline-root → rotating-delegated-signer split ships.
 *
 * `bootId`/`uptimeResetAt` are the REQUIRED gate-external liveness (G3) the Execution Uncertainty
 * carries and the §13 verifier cross-checks — a bare, unverifiable "unknown" is never accepted.

  // keyring — the one `engine.ts:711` hands to `verifyArtifact` for LIVE Decision verification —
  // was rebuilt from the same inputs WITHOUT it, so `verifyArtifact` saw `undefined` and skipped
  // the activation check entirely. A future-activated approver could sign before activation and
  // pass. Current alpha constructors choose a past `validFrom`, which bounds the exposure, but
  // `createGate` accepts an injected `GateTrust`.
  //
  // I fixed the EVIDENCE resolver for this same class one batch earlier and wrote a test asserting
  // "the ROOT path and the MANIFEST path carry activation the SAME way" — without asking whether a
  // THIRD resolver existed. It did, and it is this one. That is the "fix landed on one sibling"
  // pattern for the third time in this file family.
  //
  // ── P0-7 (2026-07-31): THE SENTENCE THAT USED TO END THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE WAS FALSE ───────────
  // It read, verbatim: "the parity test added with this change is what makes a fourth one fail
  // loudly instead of silently." NO SUCH TEST EXISTED when that was written — `grep -rn "parity"
  // packages/gate/test/` returned nothing, and deleting all four `validFrom` properties below left
  // every then-existing test GREEN (re-measured 2026-07-31 before this correction). The claim is
  // WITHDRAWN and recorded here rather than deleted: a source comment asserting a control that is
  // not there is exactly the defect class the same batch was adjudicating. The control now exists,
  // is measured, and is registered so it cannot silently disappear:
  //   [proof: RES-PAR-GATE-KEYRING] test/keyring-resolver-parity.test.ts — goes RED (3 tests,
  //     214 pass/2 fail -> 211 pass/5 fail) under that exact four-deletion mutation; restoration
  //     hash-verified.
  //   [proof: RES-PAR-XRES-EQUIV] packages/e2e-demo/test/keyring-resolver-parity.test.ts —
  //     cross-resolver equivalence proven at the real verifier.
  //   scripts/lint-resolver-parity.mjs + scripts/resolver-inventory.json — a BLOCKING census gate:
  //     a resolver that appears or disappears, and a registered proof that stops resolving, each
  //     fail the gate for its own named reason.
  //
  // ── CORRECTED 2026-07-31 (batch-A QA, finding F-4) ────────────────────────────────────────────
  // The line above previously also claimed the census gate fails when a resolver "drops
  // validFrom/revokedAt". That is TRUE only for a STRUCTURAL drop (the property is deleted from the
  // literal, which changes the recorded carriage from `explicit` to `absent`). It is FALSE for a
  // VALUE substitution: writing `validFrom: null` keeps the property present, so the gate still
  // reads `explicit` and stays exit 0. MEASURED. The defect is not undetected — the e2e parity test
  // catches it (12 pass -> 11) — but the sentence overstated WHICH control catches it, and this
  // file's whole history is claims that named the wrong control. Value-provenance checking is
  // deliberately NOT built: the test layer already covers it, and a second mechanism would be
  // theatre. Tracked as P1 (F-4).
