/**
 * NOA Gate — the exact-execution wrapper (D3/D14/D18, §8): `noa hold-and-run` / `noa.guard(...)`.
 *
 * Wraps a command: hold → wait for the human → reserve the grant → execute → report/consumption.
 * The load-bearing guarantee is D14 exact-execution binding: the params are snapshotted up front and
 * DEEP-FROZEN (ENFORCED; params that cannot be honestly frozen are refused before the hold exists),
 * the paramsHash is derived from that snapshot, and — right before dispatch — the wrapper RE-DERIVES
 * the hash from the same snapshot and refuses to run on ANY mismatch with the grant's bound
 * `paramsHash`. A caller who mutates the params object after approval (approve action A, run action
 * B) is refused (TOCTOU closed). The executor itself is captured at entry, so it cannot be swapped
 * after the human decides, and it RECEIVES the `ExecutionCommand` this boundary constructs from what
 * was granted. The gate's atomic CAS at `/reserve` is the authoritative single-use enforcer; the
 * wrapper never executes without a fresh RESERVED grant.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT ESTABLISH, stated in the header because the paragraph above is exactly
 * the kind of claim a reader over-reads. Everything above binds what was AUTHORIZED and what was
 * DISPATCHED. Nothing here observes what the executor DID. That binding needs credential custody at
 * the boundary or a target that validates a request-bound capability under its own key — ADR-0006
 * stages 9 and 10, one-way doors, neither taken. The gate reports EXECUTED for a dispatch it
 * authorized, never for an outcome it witnessed.

/**
 * ADR-0006-A part B — WHAT THE BOUNDARY AUTHORIZED, CONSTRUCTED BY THE BOUNDARY.
 *
 * Before this existed, `execute` took NO ARGUMENTS: the gate hashed a params snapshot, compared it to
 * the grant, and then called a function the caller wrote, which dispatched from its own closure
 * locals. The authorized command was ambient state in the caller and had no representation the gate
 * could hand over, log, or reconcile against.
 *
 * Every field is either the gate's own derivation or an identifier already on `GuardResult` — no new
 * information reaches the holder.
 *
 * ⚠ NOTE THE DELIBERATE ABSENCES, because each is a defect that was proposed and rejected:
 *
 *   • NO `riskClass`, NO `reversible`. Those are the CALLER'S labels. The wrapper never verified them
 *     (B-1 moved risk derivation inside the trusted boundary, and the grant this wrapper reads carries
 *     only `{grantId, paramsHash}`), so echoing them here would let a nested consumer read
 *     `command.riskClass` as "the gate classified this" — the M2 launder on a new surface. The
 *     authoritative risk lives in the SIGNED envelope and is joined via `grantId`.
 *   • NO `mode` discriminant and NO RAW variant. MEASURED: RAW cannot reach the executor. `engine.ts`
 *     derives the mode from the projection registry rather than accepting the caller's, then returns
 *     422 for RAW unconditionally under the B-1 migration clause — "it is no longer a hold-creation
 *     path". A RAW branch would be unconstructible, and unreachable code inside the TCB is a comfort
 *     blanket. Pinned by the test `RAW cannot reach the executor at all`, so the omission is a
 *     measurement rather than an assumption.

 * success would be decorative — the same shape as the `Object.freeze` on an attacker-species array
 * that `projections.ts` documents as having been defeated through `join()`.
 *
 * So the walker accepts what it can honestly freeze and FAILS CLOSED on everything else, BEFORE the
 * hold exists and before any human is asked anything.

  //
  // Everything below this line is a consequence of it. Review #5 closed the bare-throw case; review
  // #6 showed the remaining two doors were the same door. A tool could claim "no side effect
  // occurred" by MARKING the value it threw (a global `Symbol.for` property — forgeable by anyone,
  // including the tool being judged) or by RETURNING `{ ok: false }`. Both produced a gate-signed
  // determinate `FAILED_BEFORE_DISPATCH` with `ran:false`, which the reducer classifies safe to
  // retry, for an operation that may already have moved money.
  //
  // Neither claim is verifiable, and no token scheme makes it so: the gate would have to hand the
  // token TO the tool, so a returned token proves the claim came from inside this invocation and
  // nothing about the side effect. The fact is observable only to the party being judged. So the
  // claims are not authenticated — they are no longer believed. What the tool says about its own
  // side effect is recorded as DETAIL and never as a verdict.
  //
  // A determinate "nothing ran" remains available on the two edges where someone OTHER than the tool
  // observed it: every pre-dispatch refusal above (deny / params mismatch / reserve race / an
  // uncloneable params object — all `ran:false`, all gate-observed), and reconciliation against the
  // remote system of record (`SIDE_EFFECT_UNCONFIRMED -> RECONCILED_NOT_PERFORMED`). Cost: an honest
  // tool that genuinely refused before dispatch now yields UNKNOWN_AFTER_DISPATCH and needs
  // reconciliation. That is the trade the reviewer named — safety beats convenience, because a false
  // "no side effect" is the worst verdict this system can emit.
  // ADR-0006-A part B — THE BOUNDARY CONSTRUCTS THE COMMAND, HERE, AND HANDS IT OVER.
  //
  // Built AFTER the D14 re-derivation and AFTER the reserve, from `secondHash.hash` — the gate's OWN
  // derivation — and never from `grant.paramsHash`, even though the two were just proven equal. The
  // grant's value arrived over the transport; ours did not. `sign(what we built)`, never
  // `sign(what we were handed)`, is the same discipline stage 8 states for the signer.

    //     TCB is untestable, and untestable code that only ever runs at the worst possible moment
    //     is a comfort blanket, not a control.
    //   • hardcoding `"DISPATCHED"` here instead of `state` — this ALSO independently closed the
    //     defect, which made the read-order fix survive its own knockout: with a second control in
    //     place, neither was individually observable.
    //

    // the others, and the suite reports green while nothing in particular is being tested. One
    // control, measured, beats three controls and no signal.
