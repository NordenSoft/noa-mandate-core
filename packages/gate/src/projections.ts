/**
 * NOA Gate — ENFORCED-mode display projections (D22).
 *
 * A projection is a REGISTERED, reviewed, pinned adapter — **never caller-supplied code**. Each is
 * side-effect-free, deterministic, network-less and versioned, and its identity (`{id,version,hash}`)
 * is bound into the signed Hold Envelope.
 *
 * ─── WHAT `hash` COMMITS TO — ADR-0006-A PART A, owner-decided 2026-08-03 ────────────────────────
 *
 * `hash` is a sha256 over `{id, version, kind, implementation}`, where `implementation` is the
 * sha256 of the adapter's EMITTED SOURCE TEXT. Change `run()` in any way and the identity changes.
 *
 * HISTORY, KEPT BECAUSE THE CORRECTION IS THE POINT. Until this change `hash` covered `{id, version,
 * kind}` — THREE SELF-DECLARED STRINGS — and nothing about `run()`. An adapter with entirely
 * different behaviour reproduced the shipped identity byte-for-byte, so the signed envelope pinned a
 * NAME, not a renderer. Before THAT, this docstring claimed the opposite ("a verifier can pin which
 * reviewed adapter ran without re-running it") while the code did no such thing — a load-bearing
 * false claim, corrected 2026-07-30 to say so plainly and deferred to ADR-0006. The owner took that
 * decision on 2026-08-03 and this is its implementation.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO, STATED WITH THE SAME FORCE THE OLD CAVEAT HAD:
 *
 *   • It is a WITHIN-BUILD commitment. The digest is computed by the same process that runs the
 *     adapter, so it proves the identity TRACKS the artifact — not that any particular artifact is
 *     the reviewed one. An off-box verifier can only compare it against a published expected value;
 *     it cannot recompute it without the build.
 *   • It commits to the EMITTED artifact, not to the TypeScript source. A toolchain change that
 *     alters emit without altering behaviour DOES change the identity. That is the correct semantics
 *     for an artifact commitment and it is the price of the property — `test/projection.test.ts`
 *     names both legitimate causes of drift so a compiler bump is diagnosed, not investigated.
 *   • It says nothing about WHO reviewed the artifact. An authenticated, versioned ProjectionBundle
 *     manifest is still ADR-0006 stage 8 and still not built here.
 *   • It commits to `run()`'s OWN source text only. Behaviour reached through free variables — the
 *     allowlist table, `commandView`, the canonicalizer — is outside the commitment: an edit there
 *     changes behaviour without moving the identity. The identity is a NECESSARY signal for
 *     substitution, never a SUFFICIENT one for equivalence. Whole-bundle commitment is the stage-8
 *     manifest.
 *
 *     ⚠ This bullet exists because the sentence above ("change `run()` in any way and the identity
 *     changes") is true but invites a FALSE converse: *identity unchanged ⇒ behaviour unchanged*.
 *     Concretely — add `"/bin/sh": "LOW"` to `REVIEWED_EXECUTABLES` and the risk floor of every shell
 *     invocation drops while both identities stay byte-identical. Widening the hash to cover the
 *     module text was considered and REFUSED: it is stage-8 shape smuggled in, and it would make
 *     every comment edit an identity event.
 *
 * The registry is sealed at module load (B-3, below), so within one process there is exactly one
 * adapter per canonical and the identity it advertises is the identity of the code that will run.
 *
 * Alpha ships ONE ENFORCED adapter, `noa.command.exec/1` — a shell-command bind (D14: the command
 * string alone is insufficient; the canonical param set is executable real-path + argv + cwd +
 * allowed-env-hash + stdin-hash + tenant + target-env). The gate CANONICALIZES the real params
 * itself and computes `paramsHash`; a caller-supplied `paramsHash` that disagrees is REJECTED
 * (ENFORCED never trusts the caller's hash).

 * every split reachable today: once the snapshot is a plain array literal built in one read per index,
 * `join()` and the indices cannot disagree.
 *
 * By this repository's own standard that makes it a STRUCTURAL INVARIANT, not a measured control —
 * `wrapper.ts` deleted two defences on exactly this evidence ("Redundant defences read as prudence and
 * measure as blindness"). The difference from that case, and the reason it is kept: there, the
 * redundant defence made the OTHER control unobservable. Here it does not — knocking out capture-once
 * alone still turns two tests RED with this node in place. So it hides nothing; it removes a class of
 * FUTURE defect (a fourth read of a caller-influenced value added later cannot diverge, because there
 * is no second input to diverge over), which is the same "make it unwritable" argument as the Slice 1
 * signature change.
 *
 * FLAGGED FOR THE ARCHITECT rather than decided here: keeping an unobservable defence is in tension
 * with the anti-redundancy rule, and removing it would be improvising a different design than the one
 * that was settled. The knockout matrix is:
 *     A  restore Array.prototype.slice        -> capture-once + length-drift RED
