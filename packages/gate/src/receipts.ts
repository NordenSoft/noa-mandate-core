/**
 * NOA Gate — the gate-signed RECEIPTS (spec §5/§8).
 *
 * These are `noa.receipt/0.1` receipts (the FROZEN core), built with `noa-receipt`'s own
 * `buildReceipt` — never re-implemented, never a new field (Red Line 5, the reuse-first rule). The gate signs
 * the DEFERRED (freeze), the EXECUTED/FAILED (attempt), and — D19 — the timeout BLOCKED receipt.
 * The ALLOWED/BLOCKED verdict receipt from a human decision is built by the PHONE, not here (D18).
 *
 * D19 — `buildTimeoutReceipt` did not exist in `noa-receipt` and the spec (§5) says ADD it. We add
 * it HERE, in the gate, as a pure wrapper over `buildReceipt` (no core-package change, no schema
 * change): `agent:{id:"approval-timeout-policy", principal:"POLICY"}`,
 * `governance:{verdict:"BLOCKED", ruleId:"approval-timeout", approval:null}`, signed by the
 * GATE/POLICY signer — never a human key. A timed-out approval is a DISTINCT outcome, never dressed
 * up as ALLOWED and never mislabeled as a human denial (Red Line 6).
