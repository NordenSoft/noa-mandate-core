/**
 * NOA Gate — the pure business core (spec §8). The node:http layer (server.ts) is a thin adapter
 * over these methods; every rule is here so it is unit-testable without a socket.
 *
 * GATE = TRUSTED SIGNER. This engine mints every gate-side signed artifact and owns the
 * AUTHORITATIVE atomic single-use grant record. The load-bearing invariants it encodes:
 *   - D18: the PHONE never mints a ticket/grant. The gate re-verifies the human decision
 *     (signature + F15 role tier + exact-action binding + APPROVE↔ALLOWED), resolves the hold, and
 *     THEN issues the Execution Grant.
 *   - D13/F8a: the grant's single-use is enforced by an ATOMIC CAS UNUSED→RESERVED at RESERVE time,
 *     strictly BEFORE dispatch — never on a post-execution report, never by a wrapper-local flag.
 *   - F8b order: reserve → execute → durable EXECUTED/FAILED receipt → sign Consumption.
 *   - F8c: a wrapper's `/report{UNKNOWN}` is a HINT ONLY (202, no synchronous signature). The gate
 *     signs an Execution Uncertainty ONLY on its own corroboration (stuck-RESERVED past the sweep
 *     window), carrying the REQUIRED bootId/uptimeResetAt (G3).
 *   - D6/D19: EXPIRED is a distinct terminal state; its receipt is BLOCKED via buildTimeoutReceipt
 *     (POLICY signer), never ALLOWED, never a human denial.
 *   - F9/F10: every terminal hold emits a gate-signed Hold Resolution with the gate's trusted
 *     receivedAt (never the phone's decidedAt).

   *
   * THE ONE place a request body becomes data this engine will reason about. Every trusted entry
   * point below (`createHold`, `decide`, `report`) calls this FIRST and never sees anything else.
   *
   * WHY THE SIGNATURE AND NOT THE LEAVES. Three previous rounds fixed this defect class at the
   * leaves, and each produced a new instance of it, because the shape of the code kept the defect
   * WRITABLE: an entry point that takes a live object holds a caller reference and its parsed
   * snapshot in the SAME SCOPE, so every call site is a coin flip between two identifiers that look
   * equally correct. Measured on the tree immediately before this change, with both bindings in
   * scope inside `decide()`:
   *
   *     engine.ts:636  verdictReceipt: rDoc            <- the snapshot. correct.
   *     engine.ts:635  decisionArtifact                <- the LIVE caller object. one line up.
   *
   *   `buildHoldResolution` hands that live object to `refHash` (`resolution.ts:32`), which
   *   canonicalizes it and therefore INVOKES ITS ACCESSORS. A two-faced `reasonCode` — signed value
   *   to read #1, attacker value to every later read — produced this:
   *
   *     gate-SIGNED holdResolution.decisionArtifactHash : sha256:8efd3224...
   *     refHash(the VERIFIED snapshot)                  : sha256:0141ca02...
   *     signed hash commits to the VERIFIED doc?        false
   *     signed hash commits to the ATTACKER's doc?      true
   *
   *   The gate signed a commitment to a document it never verified. Nothing was forged; the
   *   approver's signature is genuine and covers the honest artifact.
   *
   * MOVING THE BOUNDARY TO THE SIGNATURE DOES NOT DEFEND AGAINST THAT DEFECT — IT MAKES IT
   * UNWRITABLE. Once the parameter is `Uint8Array`, the identifier `decisionArtifact` does not exist
   * in `decide()`, so the line above is a COMPILE ERROR rather than a code-review question. That is
   * the whole reason this is a signature change and not another leaf patch.
   *
   * A non-bytes argument needs no separate check here: the core boundary's type test reads an
   * internal slot, is total and trap-free, and refuses an object WITH A REASON instead of coercing
   * it — so a caller that still passes a live object gets a 422 naming what a document is.

    // THE INVARIANT: once an external operation has been invoked, no self-report by the executing
    // party may establish that no side effect occurred. A determinate negative requires an observer
    // OTHER than the executed party.
    //
    // THE CORRECTION THAT MATTERS (adversarial review, 2026-07-28 — read this before touching the
    // branches below). An earlier version of this fix keyed determinacy on the grant's status: it
    // signed a determinate FAILED_BEFORE_DISPATCH when the grant was still `UNUSED`, reasoning that
    // "the F8a CAS never ran, so the gate never authorized a dispatch."
    //
    // That premise is FALSE, and the code three hundred lines up says so: `decide()` issues a
    // gate-SIGNED `ExecutionGrant` (`issueGrant`, ~:518) and `holdView()` hands it straight to the
    // agent as `executionGrant` (~:786) while the record is still `UNUSED`. The authorization is the
    // signed grant. `reserve()` is the single-use BURN, not the authorization — and it is a
    // voluntary call the executing party alone decides whether to make.
    //
    // So `UNUSED` never meant "no dispatch was authorized". It means "the agent did not tell me it
    // was about to dispatch", which is a statement about the agent's cooperation, not an
    // observation of the world. An agent holding the signed grant could execute out of band, skip
    // `reserve()` entirely, and collect a gate-signed determinate "it did not run" — the C-04
    // artifact, obtained with ONE FEWER call than the original attack. The fix had relocated the
    // vulnerability and made it cheaper.
    //
    // THE RULE NOW, WITHOUT AN EXCEPTION: `report()` never signs a determinate negative. There is no
    // state in which it can, because there is no state in which this method observes non-dispatch.
    //   • `UNUSED`   → 409. The gate has nothing to say; an unreserved grant that is never used
    //                  simply leaves the hold without execution evidence, which the evidence layer
    //                  already renders as APPROVED_NO_EXECUTION_EVIDENCE (a frozen §13 member).

    // wrapper's pre-dispatch refusals (`packages/gate/src/wrapper.ts` — DENIED, EXPIRED, CANCELLED,
    // params mismatch, a lost reserve race) all return `ran: false`, and there the non-dispatch IS
