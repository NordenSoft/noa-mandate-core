/**
 * createProxyServer — builds one governed MCP `Server` in front of one already-connected
 * downstream `Client`. This is the reusable core both the stdio CLI entrypoint (proxy.mjs) and
 * the smoke test embed directly, so the smoke test can exercise the exact same request-handling
 * code the CLI ships, not a re-implementation of it.
 *
 * Two request handlers, both fail-closed:
 *   - tools/list  → ALWAYS asks the downstream, live, right now (dynamic reflection: no static
 *     tool table is ever cached here).
 *   - tools/call  → runs preCheck FIRST (compute → persist → commit, see below). ALLOW forwards
 *     to the downstream and returns its real result. DENY (policy rule, malformed input, or ANY
 *     unexpected exception) never forwards — the downstream tool handler is never invoked — and
 *     the host receives an MCP error carrying the receipt id + the rule that fired.
 *
 * compute → persist → commit ordering, with a per-session serialization invariant: the session's
 * chain position (`store`) is only advanced AFTER `onReceipt` has been called and (if it returned
 * a promise) has resolved. `onReceipt` MAY be asynchronous/non-blocking (e.g. a non-blocking
 * `fs.promises.appendFile`, see proxy.mjs's `--receipt-log` writer) — but two concurrent
 * `tools/call` invocations for the SAME session must never both "prepare" a receipt off the
 * store's un-advanced `{prev,seq}` before the first call's commit has actually run (that would
 * issue a duplicate/gap seq and corrupt the chain). `sessionCallQueues` below chains every call
 * for a given `sessionId` onto that session's own promise tail — a session-scoped mutex around
 * exactly the prepare→persist→commit critical section — so same-session calls serialize their
 * commit ordering while calls for DIFFERENT sessions still run fully concurrently, and the actual
 * downstream forward (the slow part) happens OUTSIDE the lock, after the commit/deny decision is
 * already settled. If `onReceipt` throws/rejects — e.g. a receipt-log append hitting ENOSPC — the
 * call is rejected closed and the session's seq is left untouched, so the very next call for this
 * session re-issues the exact same seq: a persist failure can never leave a gap in the middle of
 * the persisted chain. See `noa-mcp-adapter-core`'s `prepareSessionReceipt`/`commitSessionReceipt`
 * for the two-phase API this relies on.
 *
 * Session lifecycle: `server.onclose` (fired by the MCP SDK when the host-facing transport
 * closes, for any reason — see `node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/.../shared/protocol.d.ts`)
 * drops this session's chain state from `store`, so a long-running proxy process does not
 * accumulate state for sessions whose host has disconnected. Its `store.end(sessionId)` call is
 * routed through the SAME per-session exclusive queue (`runExclusiveForSession`, below) as
 * `tools/call`'s own prepare→persist→commit critical section — NOT run immediately/synchronously
 * — so an abrupt disconnect firing `onclose` WHILE a call is mid-flight (receipt already prepared
 * and handed to `onReceipt`, not yet committed) can only land BEFORE that call's task starts or
 * AFTER it has fully settled, never in the middle. (Before this fix, `onclose` ran `store.end()`
 * immediately, outside the queue — landing it in that exact window let the in-flight call's LATER
 * commit silently auto-vivify a brand-new segment and graft its now-stale receipt onto it as that
 * fresh segment's `prev`, corrupting the NEXT segment's seq; see `noa-mcp-adapter-core`'s
 * `createChainSessionStore` — the "COMMIT-TIME SEGMENT CHECK" docstring section — for the second,
 * independent layer of this same fix.) `runExclusiveForSession`'s own self-draining logic already
 * cleans up `sessionCallQueues`' entry for this session once the queued end-task settles (as long
 * as no newer call queued behind it since — see its docstring below), so no separate cleanup is
 * needed here. `store` itself ALSO bounds unattended growth independently (idle-TTL sweep +
 * max-sessions cap — see `noa-mcp-adapter-core`'s `createChainSessionStore`) for hosts that never
 * cleanly close.
