/**
 * init.mjs — `noa-mcp-proxy init`: scaffolds the artifacts the R4 human-approval gate needs to
 * START, into a target directory.
 *
 * THIS IS SCAFFOLDING, NOT ACTIVATION. Do not read a clean exit from this command as "the gate is
 * now protecting anything" — it is not, until every one of the following is also true:
 *   1. an MCP host's config actually launches `proxy.mjs` wrapping your real downstream, pointed at
 *      the files this command writes (see this package's README, "Human-approval gate (R4)" and
 *      "Run it yourself");
 *   2. the generated `approval-rules.json` actually matches YOUR tool/action ids — the starter rule
 *      below matches ONLY the bundled demo tool, and a rule that matches nothing you own holds
 *      nothing of yours; and
 *   3. a real HUMAN runs `noa-approve` out-of-band for every held call, from a separate terminal,
 *      holding the approver private key this command mints — that human's judgment is the control;
 *      this package only proves, cryptographically, what they decided, after the fact; and
 *   4. the agent RETRIES the identical held call once approved — approval does not itself re-execute
 *      anything.
 * "One command and you're done" is a claim this project's own review explicitly rejected; do not
 * reintroduce it in help text, a commit message, or documentation that wraps this command. Nothing
 * generated here is described as "unforgeable" or "cannot be bypassed" — see NON-CLAIMS.md and
 * THREAT-MODEL.md before relying on any of it.
 *
 * Generates, under --dir (default "."):
 *   approval-rules.json     A starter rule set: this package's OWN demo transfer-guard fixture
 *                            (src/policy.mjs's `APPROVAL_RULES` — the exact array Scenario R in
 *                            test/smoke.mjs exercises). It holds `transfer_funds` calls of >= 5000
 *                            minor units from the BUNDLED demo-downstream.mjs. A real integration
 *                            MUST replace `match.action` (and, if used, `threshold.path`) with its
 *                            own tool/action ids before this protects anything of the operator's own.
 *   pending-store.jsonl      The empty JSONL operational index --pending-store points at. Empty and
 *                            "does not exist yet" fold to the identical state (see adapter-core's
 *                            pending-store.mjs) — creating it here is a real, inspectable starting
 *                            point, not a magic trick.
 *   approver-key.json        A FRESH Ed25519 signing identity for the human-approver seat, written
 *                            mode 0600 through noa-mcp-adapter-core's `loadOrCreateKeyFile` — the
 *                            SAME CWE-367/TOCTOU-hardened helper packages/signer-sidecar's sidecar
 *                            uses, never a hand-rolled `writeFileSync`. Hand this path to
 *                            `noa-approve --key-file` and NOWHERE else — whoever holds it IS the
 *                            approval seat, in full.
 *   approver-keyring.json    The PUBLIC `{ kid: publicKey }` derived from approver-key.json — what
 *                            `--approver-keyring` feeds the proxy so it can authenticate that seat's
 *                            signature. Sharing this file is fine; sharing approver-key.json is the
 *                            same as handing over the approval seat itself.
 *
 * Refuses to silently overwrite: the pre-flight check runs as ONE BATCH, over all four paths,
 * BEFORE any write begins — so a directory where NONE of the four is occupied gets all four
 * written, and a directory where ANY of the four is already occupied (a regular file, a
 * directory, or a symlink — dangling or not; see the CWE-367 note below) refuses the run before
 * touching anything, unless --force is given, in which case all four are regenerated fresh
 * (including a BRAND NEW approver identity — any approval-in-flight signed under the old one
 * stops verifying against the new keyring).
 *
 * Honest limit on that guarantee: the pre-flight check is atomic as a CHECK, not as a WRITE. Once
 * writing begins, the four files are still created one at a time; a failure partway through
 * (a disk error, or a file appearing at one of the four paths in the window between the
 * pre-flight check and that specific write — the same TOCTOU class CWE-367 names) can leave
 * earlier files in this run on disk and later ones missing. On any write failure this prints
 * exactly which of the four were confirmed written before the failure, rather than claiming
 * either "all four" or "none" by default.
 *
 * CWE-367 (symlink / TOCTOU): every one of the four writes below uses the SAME
 * `O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW` guard, applied uniformly rather than only on the one file that
 * happens to hold key material. `O_EXCL` alone already makes the OS refuse to create through a
 * PRE-EXISTING symlink at the target path — dangling or not, per POSIX open(2) — independently of
 * where the link points; `O_NOFOLLOW` is belt-and-suspenders on platforms that support it. For
 * approver-key.json specifically, the actual write still goes through
 * noa-mcp-adapter-core's `loadOrCreateKeyFile` (mode 0600, the same helper packages/signer-sidecar
 * uses) rather than the local helper below — that helper carries its own, independently-audited
 * version of this exact guard; the local helper here exists because no equivalent is exported from
 * noa-mcp-adapter-core for non-key files (checked: index.mjs exports nothing narrower than the
 * key-file loader for a single-file exclusive create).

 * already explains why `loadOrCreateKeyFile` is preferred for the private key specifically) with a

This is SCAFFOLDING, not activation. Nothing is protected yet. To actually see the gate hold and
release one call:

  1. Point an MCP host (or this package's own demo) at the proxy with the gate on, e.g.:
       node <path-to-proxy.mjs> \\
         --approval-rules ${shellQuote(rulesPath)} \\
         --pending-store ${shellQuote(pendingStorePath)} \\
         --approver-keyring ${shellQuote(approverKeyringPath)} \\
         -- node <path-to-your-downstream-server>
  2. A call matching the starter rule (transfer_funds, amountMinor >= 5000, against the bundled
     demo downstream) is HELD — the proxy returns an MCP error carrying the DEFERRED receipt id;
     the downstream is never invoked.
  3. From a SEPARATE terminal, a human holding approver-key.json resolves it out-of-band:
       noa-approve approve --id <receiptId> --by you@example.com \\
         --pending-store ${shellQuote(pendingStorePath)} --key-file ${shellQuote(approverKeyPath)}
  4. The agent retries the IDENTICAL call. Only then does the proxy adopt the signed approval and
     forward it — approving does not itself re-execute anything.
