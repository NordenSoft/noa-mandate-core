/**
 * proxy.mjs — the CLI entrypoint an MCP host launches EXACTLY like it would launch the
 * downstream server directly, except wrapped:
 *
 *   Before:  { "command": "node", "args": ["demo-downstream.mjs"] }
 *   After:   { "command": "node", "args": ["proxy.mjs", "--", "node", "demo-downstream.mjs"] }
 *
 * Everything after the first bare `--` is the REAL downstream command, spawned exactly as the
 * host would have spawned it itself. The downstream file is never edited, never re-imported,
 * never made aware a proxy exists — the host's config line is the only thing that changes.
 *
 * `proxy.mjs init [--dir <path>] [--force]` is a SEPARATE subcommand (see src/init.mjs) that
 * scaffolds the human-approval gate's inputs (approval-rules.json, pending-store.jsonl, an
 * approver keypair) into a target directory. It is scaffolding, not activation — read init.mjs's
 * own doc comment before assuming a clean exit means anything is protected yet.
 *
 * Flags (all optional):
 *   --session-id <id>          receipt-chain session id (default: a fresh randomUUID())
 *   --tenant <name>            receipt scope.tenant (default: "default-tenant")
 *   --agent-id <id>            STATIC receipt.agent.id for every call this process makes (default:
 *                              the session id, the prior behavior). Read ONLY from this flag/env —
 *                              never from a tool call's own arguments, so a host or downstream tool
 *                              can never spoof its own attribution.
 *   --receipt-log <path>       append each emitted DECISION receipt as one JSON line (JSONL), written
 *                              with a non-blocking fs.promises.appendFile so a slow disk never blocks
 *                              the event loop for other in-flight sessions.
 *   --outcome-log <path>       (R2) append each POST-execution OUTCOME receipt as one JSON line — the
 *                              signed attestation of what a tool call actually DID (success/error),
 *                              distinct from the pre-execution decision receipt in --receipt-log.
 *                              Written with the same non-blocking appender. Verify offline with
 *                              verifyOutcomeReceipt() against the --keyring-file.
 *   --http-port <n>            (R2) serve over HTTP+SSE (Streamable HTTP) on this port INSTEAD of
 *                              stdio — stdio stays the default when this is omitted. Each MCP session
 *                              gets its own downstream connection + receipt chain, fronted by the
 *                              exact same governed proxy as stdio (same fail-closed gate; the gate is
 *                              not forked per transport).
 *   --http-host <host>         (R2) bind address for --http-port (default 127.0.0.1 — loopback only;
 *                              set 0.0.0.0 deliberately to expose beyond localhost).
 *   --keyring-file <path>      write { [kid]: publicKey } once at startup, so an external verifier
 *                              can `verifyChain`/`verify` the receipt log independently of this
 *                              process.
 *   --key-file <path>          load a persisted signing identity from this path, or — if it
 *                              doesn't exist yet — generate one and write it here (mode 0600, since
 *                              it holds a private key). Without this flag, the prior behavior is
 *                              unchanged: a fresh Ed25519 keypair every process start (kid tied to
 *                              this run's session id). WITH it, restarting the proxy against the
 *                              SAME --key-file reuses the exact same kid — receipts emitted before
 *                              AND after a restart verify under that ONE signing identity/external
 *                              keyring. Honest limit: a restart still begins a NEW, distinct
 *                              receipt-chain SEGMENT (`scope.chain` differs — see
 *                              noa-mcp-adapter-core's createChainSessionStore, which mints a fresh
 *                              per-process-lifetime token specifically so a restarted process can
 *                              never collide with its pre-restart chain-id even when reusing the
 *                              same --session-id); it does NOT resume one continuous chain spanning
 *                              the restart. Each segment verifies independently on its own — group
 *                              receipts by `scope.chain` before calling `verifyChain()`, exactly as
 *                              noa-mcp-adapter-core's README documents. True cross-restart
 *                              continuity of ONE logical chain would additionally require
 *                              persisting the session's `{prev,seq}` state itself, which this
 *                              package does not do (see its "Honest limits" section). Alternative:
 *                              the NOA_MCP_PROXY_KEY_FILE env var (the flag wins if both are
 *                              given).
 *   --session-idle-ttl-ms <n>  override the session store's idle-TTL sweep (default: 1 hour;
 *                              see noa-mcp-adapter-core's createChainSessionStore).
 *   --max-sessions <n>         override the session store's max-sessions cap (default: 10,000).
 *   --session-dir <path>       opt-in file-backed session store (noa-mcp-adapter-core's
 *                              createFileSessionStore): persists each session's chain position to
 *                              disk under this directory, so a restart resumes the SAME chain
 *                              segment instead of starting a fresh one (unlike the default
 *                              in-memory store, which always mints a fresh segment on restart —
 *                              see this package's README "Honest limits"). Independent of
 *                              --key-file: --session-dir alone still generates a fresh signing
 *                              key every restart unless --key-file is ALSO given; combine both
 *                              for a fully restart-durable proxy. Only one live process may point
 *                              at a given --session-dir at a time (lockfile-enforced).
 *   --signer-socket <path>     use a remote signer (packages/signer-sidecar's client) reachable
 *                              at this Unix domain socket path instead of a local, in-process
 *                              private key — the private key never lives in THIS process when
 *                              this flag is given. Mutually exclusive with --key-file /
 *                              NOA_MCP_PROXY_KEY_FILE (the sidecar owns its own --key-file
 *                              independently). Fails closed at startup if the sidecar is
 *                              unreachable — see createRemoteSigner's own doc comment.
 *   --approval-rules <path>    JSON array of human-approval rules (adapter-core's approvalRules): a
 *                              matching tool call is HELD (DEFERRED), never forwarded, until a human
 *                              approves it out-of-band with `noa-approve`.
 *   --pending-store <path>     JSONL operational index of outstanding approvals the DEFERRED holds
 *                              are recorded into and `noa-approve` resolves against.
 *   --approver-keyring <path>  REQUIRED whenever --approval-rules/--pending-store is set: a
 *                              `{ [kid]: publicKey }` JSON of TRUSTED approver keys. An approval's
 *                              Ed25519 signature is verified against this before the held action is
 *                              adopted + forwarded — the proxy REFUSES TO START without it (a gate
 *                              that could adopt unverifiable approvals would be fail-open).
 *   --approver-identity <path> optional `{ [agentId]: kid[] }` identity manifest pinning which kid
 *                              may sign for the approval seat, so a co-trusted key cannot impersonate
 *                              the human approver.
 *
 * Fail-closed at startup: if the downstream command cannot be spawned or fails MCP
 * initialization, this process logs to stderr and exits non-zero WITHOUT ever starting to serve
 * the host — there is no partially-working proxy state.

  // array — was accepted, and the same 7000 transfer was FORWARDED AND EXECUTED with no human
  // approval. `readConfigJson` decides WHICH BYTES are read; it has nothing to say about whether
  // those bytes are a rule set. `matchApprovalRule` answers `null` for a non-array, `null` means
  // "no rule matched", and "no rule matched" means forward — so a two-byte file switched the gate
  // off. This removes the need for the conspicuous `[]` payload the symlink attack needed: ANY
  // content-write primitive, including the same-uid rewrite NON-CLAIMS.md NC-6.9 names as an
  // accepted residual, was a full bypass. `requireValidApprovalRules` refuses a non-array AND every
  // malformed rule — in FULL, never partially — so the process exits non-zero here rather than
  // serving the host with the gate silently absent. createProxyServer/startHttpProxy apply the
  // identical check on their own inputs (a library consumer must not be able to skip it by not
  // using this CLI); this call is what gives the OPERATOR the flag-named error.
  // THE RETURN VALUE is what travels on: a frozen, inert snapshot compiled from own data properties
  // only. Keeping the parsed object instead would keep the bug — a rule set whose fields are
  // inherited or computed, or one mutated after this line, was measured executing the same
  // unapproved 7000-unit transfer (see `requireValidApprovalRules`' own note).
