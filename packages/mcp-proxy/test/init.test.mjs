/**
 * init.test.mjs — `noa-mcp-proxy init` (src/init.mjs): the scaffolding command that generates the
 * human-approval gate's four inputs (approval-rules.json, pending-store.jsonl, approver-key.json,
 * approver-keyring.json).
 *
 * Three things this covers, matched to the task's evidence gate:
 *   1. generated-file shape — each of the four files is exactly what proxy.mjs/noa-approve expect.
 *   2. the refuse-to-overwrite path — a second `init` in the same directory writes NOTHING and
 *      exits non-zero unless --force is given, in which case it regenerates (including a genuinely
 *      NEW approver identity, not a silent no-op).
 *   3. the generated config actually starts the REAL proxy.mjs CLI with the gate ON — a real child
 *      process, real stdio, exactly the pattern test/smoke.mjs's "Bonus F" uses for the literal
 *      host-config path, not an in-process stand-in.
