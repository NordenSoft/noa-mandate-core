/**
 * BOUNDARY 2 applied at THIS package's thrown-value sites, using the SHARED corpus.
 *
 * TWO DEFECTS THIS PINS (cross-family review round 4, HIGH):
 *
 *   outcome-receipt.mjs — `truncateError` did `error?.message ?? String(error)`. A downstream tool
 *     that threw a hostile object made THAT function throw, so the ERROR outcome receipt was never
 *     built. The tool had already run; the one durable artifact recording that it ran was lost, and
 *     the value that destroyed it came from the downstream server the proxy exists to govern.
 *
 *   outcome-receipt.mjs — `verifyOutcomeReceipt` documents "never throws" and then did
 *     `err.message` in its own catch. A thrown `null`/`undefined` (or a throwing getter) turned a
 *     verification FAILURE into a raw exception, in a function whose callers were told they need no
 *     handler. A negative verification result became an unhandled rejection.
