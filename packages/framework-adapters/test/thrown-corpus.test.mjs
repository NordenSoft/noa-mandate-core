/**
 * BOUNDARY 2 applied at THIS package's thrown-value sites, using the SHARED corpus.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS (cross-family review round 4, HIGH). `ToolOutcomeNotRecorded`'s constructor
 * built its message with `cause instanceof Error ? cause.message : String(cause)`. Both halves run
 * code the thrower controls. A revoked proxy makes `instanceof` throw `TypeError`; a hostile
 * `Symbol.toPrimitive`/`toString` makes `String()` throw. Either way `new ToolOutcomeNotRecorded(…)`
 * threw, so the `throw` statement raised a plain `TypeError` instead — and the caller lost
 * `executionHappened === true`.
 *
 * That is not a message-formatting bug. `executionHappened` is the ONLY signal separating "the call
 * failed, retry it" from "the call SUCCEEDED and the receipt could not be written, do NOT retry".
 * Destroying it turns an already-executed payment into what looks like an ordinary failure, and the
 * correct handling of an ordinary failure is a retry. The exotic-throw hole and the anti-retry
 * discriminator are the same finding, which is why the type is built ON the boundary.
 *
 * Two doors per corpus value: the TOOL throws it, and the RECORDING throws it.

   * It asserted, GREEN, that a tool which throws leaves `["ALLOWED", "FAILED"]` — a signed,
   * chain-VALID terminal receipt whose verdict is the receipt-level rendering of a RETRY-SAFE
   * outcome (the gate emits exactly this verdict for a `FAILED_BEFORE_DISPATCH` consumption, and
   * the reducer marks that state `safeToRetry: true`). The tool may have moved money before it
   * threw; only the tool can know, and the tool is the party being judged.
   *
   * INVERTED, not deleted. Two properties are preserved exactly:
   *   • a falsy thrown value is still a throw — the caller is never told it succeeded;
   *   • the ORIGINAL value reaches the caller BY IDENTITY — now as `cause`/`toolFailure`, which is
   *     where it must live once the caller is also owed the anti-retry discriminator.
