/**
 * createToolGuard — the ONE shared, framework-agnostic core both the OpenAI and LangChain.js
 * façades (../openai.mjs, ../langchain.mjs) call into. Neither façade re-implements the gate
 * decision, chain bookkeeping, or fail-closed behavior — they only translate a framework's own
 * tool shape into the `{ name, args }` `preCheck`/`preCheckAsync` already understand (see
 * `noa-mcp-adapter-core`'s `pre-check.mjs`) and hand the result to `guardCall` here.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT: `guardCall(name, fn)` returns a wrapped `fn` such that the ORIGINAL `fn`
 * is invoked IF AND ONLY IF the gate decision is ALLOW. A DENY (policy rule, malformed args, or
 * any error surfaced by `preCheck`'s own fail-closed guards — see pre-check.mjs) throws
 * `GuardedToolDenied` and never calls `fn`. This mirrors the same FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT
 * `packages/mcp-proxy`'s `tools/call` handler applies for an MCP host: DENY blocks execution, ALLOW
 * forwards the call and returns its real result untouched (see create-proxy-server.mjs's
 * "FORWARD-YOK" comment) — these adapters are the same invariant for an in-process
 * OpenAI/LangChain tool registry instead of an MCP proxy boundary.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS SENTENCE USED A K5-BANNED ABSOLUTE, AND IT CONTRADICTED THIS FILE'S OWN NEXT PARAGRAPH.
 * Corrected 2026-08-04, found the moment the publish-surface lint was extended past the root package
 * — this file ships in `noa-framework-adapters` and had **never been linted at PR time**.
 *
 * The two scopes are not equivalent, and one absolute noun for both erased the difference: the proxy
 * sits at a boundary the host cannot route around, while this is IN-PROCESS and, as the HONESTY note
 * below says in the file's own words, *advisory* — it governs only calls that actually go through the
 * wrapped `fn`. Same contract, weaker enforcement position.
 *
 * The first attempt at this very note tripped the lint a second time, by naming the banned word twice
 * while explaining why it was wrong. That is the gate working: an explanation shipped in a published
 * package is published text, and K5 does not have an exemption for good intentions.
 *
 * HONESTY (same caveat as examples/sdk-guard/guard.mjs): an in-process guard is *advisory* — it
 * only governs calls that actually go through the wrapped `fn`. Install it where the tool's
 * credentials/write authority live, or an agent framework could bypass it by calling the
 * underlying API directly instead of through the guarded tool object these adapters return.

/**
 * Build the POST-attempt terminal receipt, chained onto the decision receipt.
 *
 * It reuses the decision receipt's own action fields verbatim (id / canonical / paramsHash), so the
 * outcome is unambiguously about the SAME call — a different paramsHash here would be an outcome
 * for an action nobody approved. `riskClass` follows the decision receipt so the pair reads
 * consistently. Signed by the SAME signer, appended to the SAME chain, so `verifyChain` covers the
 * decision and its outcome as one continuous, offline-verifiable history.
 *
 * WHICH DECISION THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF. The id is derived from the DECISION receipt's id
 * (`<decision-id>#outcome`) rather than from this receipt's own seq. Copying the action fields
 * proves the outcome is about the same ACTION; it does not identify WHICH CALL, and under
 * concurrency that is a real gap: two simultaneous calls with identical parameters produce
 * identical action fields, the execution deliberately runs outside the chain lock, and the outcomes
 * can therefore commit in the opposite order from their decisions (decision A, decision B, outcome
 * B, outcome A). `chain.prevHash` then links outcome A to outcome B, not to decision A, so the
 * "terminal chains directly onto its decision" property held only in the absence of concurrency.
 *
 * The decision's id is unique within the chain (`rcpt_<seq>` at decision time), so referencing it
 * makes the pairing explicit and unambiguous for every interleaving. It costs nothing at the wire
 * level: `id` is an existing receipt field and is INSIDE the signed hash pre-image, so the binding
 * is attested rather than annotated, and the frozen receipt shape is untouched (no field added).
 *
 * Returns a Promise so the sync and remote-signer paths are one code path for the caller.

/**
 * `ToolOutcomeNotRecorded` — "the wrapped tool ALREADY RAN and the terminal receipt could not be
 * produced or recorded" (the outcome signer rejected or was unreachable, or `onReceipt` threw: a
 * receipt-log append hitting ENOSPC, a durable store refusing the write).
 *
 * WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS. Both of those used to propagate raw, so a call that SUCCEEDED and merely
 * failed to be written down reached the caller as an indistinguishable bare failure. That is the one
 * error shape a caller must not confuse: retrying "the call failed" is correct, and retrying "the
 * call succeeded but was not recorded" duplicates the side effect — for a payment tool, twice. The
 * pre-execution path is deliberately NOT wrapped: a decision-receipt persist failure means nothing
 * ran, and rejecting closed there is the correct fail-closed behaviour, unchanged.
 *
 * MOVED (2026-07-27, breaking pre-1.0 — see CHANGELOG "BOUNDARY 2"): the class now lives in
 * `noa-mcp-adapter-core` because the identical state exists in `packages/gate` and
 * `packages/mcp-proxy`, and three copies of an anti-retry discriminator is three ways to get it
 * wrong. This re-export keeps `import { ToolOutcomeNotRecorded } from "noa-framework-adapters"`
 * working unchanged; the class is the SAME class, and its message is now built through the
 * thrown-value boundary so a hostile `cause` can no longer make the constructor itself throw and
 * take `executionHappened === true` down with it. Prefer `ToolOutcomeNotRecorded.is(e)` over
 * `e instanceof ToolOutcomeNotRecorded`: the brand survives duplicate package copies and realms.
 *
 *   `executionHappened`  — always `true`. The discriminator: the tool was invoked and settled.
 *   `outcome`            — `"EXECUTED"` or `"FAILED"`: what the terminal receipt WOULD have said.
 *   `result`             — the wrapped tool's return value when it succeeded (else `undefined`).
 *   `toolFailure`        — the value the tool threw when `outcome` is `"FAILED"` (by identity).
 *   `receipt`            — the terminal receipt if it was built but not recorded (else `null`).
 *   `cause`              — the original signing/persistence error, unchanged, by identity.
 *   `causeDescription`   — a SAFE string describing `cause`; read this, never `cause.message`.
 *
 * This does NOT make the outcome durable — that needs a commit protocol the wrapper does not own
 * (see THREAT-MODEL.md and docs/side-effect-unconfirmed.md). It makes the ambiguity VISIBLE instead
 * of silent, which is the part that can be fixed here.

      // FAILED on throw. This is the same discipline the gate wrapper enforces (reserve → execute →
      // durable EXECUTED/FAILED receipt) and that mcp-proxy's outcome receipt gives the MCP path.

      // ── WHY A BOOLEAN AND NOT A SENTINEL VALUE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
      // `let failure = null` used `null` as BOTH "nothing was thrown" and as a thrown value, and the
      // rethrow tested TRUTHINESS. JavaScript lets you throw anything, and `throw null` is legal, so
      // the two meanings collided: a tool doing `throw null` produced `caught: NONE`, verdicts
      // `[ALLOWED, EXECUTED]` and a chain-VALID receipt attesting that an operation which threw had
      // executed. Every other falsy throw (`undefined`, `0`, `""`, `false`, `NaN`, `0n`) recorded
      // FAILED correctly but was ALSO never re-thrown, so the caller was told the call succeeded and
      // handed `undefined` as the result.
      //
      // `threw` is set ONLY by the catch block. No value a tool can throw can produce it, and no
      // value a tool can throw can suppress it — which is the whole property that was missing. The

      // ── H-02a: THE TERMINAL OUTCOME IS THE REDUCER'S, NOT THIS FUNCTION'S ────────────────────
      // This line used to read `threw ? "FAILED" : "EXECUTED"` — the outcome computed LOCALLY from
      // the tool's own behaviour. `FAILED` is not a neutral word here: it is the receipt-level
      // rendering of a RETRY-SAFE outcome. The gate builds exactly this verdict for a
      // `FAILED_BEFORE_DISPATCH` consumption, and the reducer classifies its state
      // (`FAILED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT`) `safeToRetry: true`. So a tool that moved money and then threw
      // left a signed, chain-VALID receipt attesting a retry-safe failure — C-04's exact shape,
      // one package over, reached without any realm compromise.
      //
      // The reducer already models this correctly and refuses to be talked out of it: from
      // DISPATCHED there is NO transition to a retry-safe state without a `RECONCILED_*` event.
      // Routing through it rather than re-deriving an answer here is the whole fix; the reasoning
      // lives once, at packages/adapter-core/src/side-effect-state.mjs:117-143.

      // A throw after invocation lands in `SIDE_EFFECT_UNCONFIRMED`, whose only exits are
      // `RECONCILED_*` — positive evidence from the remote system of record, which this in-process
      // adapter does not have and cannot obtain. Its §13 evidence outcome is
      // `UNKNOWN_AFTER_DISPATCH`, and `noa.receipt/0.1`'s frozen verdict enum has no member for it
      // (ALLOWED · BLOCKED · DEFERRED · EXECUTED · FAILED · ROLLED_BACK · SIMULATED). Widening a
      // frozen wire format across five conforming verifiers, to carry a claim that is unverifiable
      // by construction, would be the wrong trade by a wide margin.
      //
      // So NO terminal receipt is signed. That is exactly the answer the gate gives for the same
      // state (`report{UNKNOWN}` → 202, no consumption; an Execution Uncertainty only on the gate's
      // OWN corroboration). Silence about an unknown is honest; a signed FAILED is not. The ALLOWED
