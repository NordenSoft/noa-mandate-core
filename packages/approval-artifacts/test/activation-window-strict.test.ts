/**
 * P0-6 — `Date.parse` IS NOT A SECURITY PARSER.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT LIVES HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A previous test of this same defect (`packages/evidence/test/root-activation-window.test.ts`) was
 * named *"a MALFORMED validFrom is carried through and fails CLOSED at the verifier"* and **never
 * invoked the verifier** — it asserted field carriage only. The name claimed an end-to-end property
 * the body did not measure. Every assertion below therefore runs the REAL `verifyArtifact` against
 * the REAL shipped conformance vector and asserts the FINAL authorization result.
 *
 * ─── THE DEFECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `parseTime` returned `Date.parse(v)` for any string. `Date.parse` does not reject malformed input;
 * it NORMALISES it into a plausible instant, which every comparison then treats as the declared one.
 * MEASURED against the shipped decision vector, with the unmodified vector ACCEPTED in the same run:
 *
 *     validFrom "0"          -> Date.parse => 1999-12-31  -> ACCEPTED (a past instant)
 *     validFrom "2026-02-30" -> Date.parse => 2026-03-02  -> ACCEPTED (that day does not exist)
 *
 * HONEST SEVERITY: exploiting this requires authoring the key record, which is already a trusted
 * position — an attacker who can write a keyring can simply declare a past activation instead. The
 * realised risk is an OPERATOR who declares a future activation and mistypes it, and whose key is
 * then silently active already. Recorded at that severity rather than inflated to a bypass.
