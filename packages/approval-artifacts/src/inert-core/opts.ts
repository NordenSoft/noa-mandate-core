/**
 * THE OPTIONS BOUNDARY — the one place a caller-owned OBJECT is still accepted, and the exact
 * runtime schema that makes accepting it safe.
 *
 * WHY AN OBJECT AT ALL. Documents are bytes (`bytes.ts`): a receipt, a checkpoint, a keyring, a
 * policy — anything signed, verified, or hashed — has no object form inside the kernel. Options are
 * different in kind: they are the CALLER's own configuration, not the attacker's document, and
 * `{ maxReceipts: 10 }` is the ergonomics the API is worth having. ADR §3.3 records this as the
 * principal's choice (H-4) and states the condition under which it costs nothing: a descriptor walk
 * that inspects properties without invoking them.
 *
 * ── THE ORDERING BUG THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AROUND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The ADR's rule — "walk `opts` with `Reflect.ownKeys` + `Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, which
 * inspect the descriptor without invoking it" — is correct about ACCESSORS and wrong about PROXIES,
 * and the difference is the whole security of this file.
 *
 * `Reflect.ownKeys` fires a Proxy's `ownKeys` trap. `Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` fires its
 * `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` trap. `Reflect.getPrototypeOf` fires `getPrototypeOf`. Every one of
 * those traps is attacker code, running inside the validator whose entire purpose is to run no
 * attacker code — and a `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` trap can return a plain data descriptor for a
 * property whose real `get` will be invoked later, so a descriptor-first validator does not merely
 * execute the attacker: it can be LIED TO by him and then wave the input through. A descriptor-walk
 * validator is itself attacker-reachable, which makes it a hole rather than a boundary.
 *
 * So the FIRST operation on the value is `util.types.isProxy`, which reads an internal slot: it
 * fires no trap for any input, cannot be intercepted, and cannot be spoofed by a property. Only
 * once the value is proven not to be a Proxy do `getPrototypeOf` / `ownKeys` /
 * `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` become the trap-free reflection the ADR assumed they were.
 *
 * WHAT IS REJECTED, and why each one is load-bearing rather than tidy:
 *   • PROXY — the trap channel above.
 *   • ACCESSOR (`get`/`set`) — reading it runs attacker code; this is the class-A defect verbatim.
 *   • FUNCTION / SYMBOL value — code, not configuration.
 *   • EXOTIC PROTOTYPE — anything but `Object.prototype` or `null`. A `Date`, a `Map`, a class
 *     instance, an array: each carries inherited machinery whose behaviour is not the caller's.
 *   • SYMBOL KEY — invisible to every string-keyed reader; a channel with no readers is a channel
 *     with no reviewers.
 *   • UNKNOWN MEMBER — a typo'd `requireTenantConsistancy` silently disabling a security default is
 *     the failure mode this closes. Unknown-key rejection turns a silent misconfiguration into a
 *     loud one.
 *   • UNBOUNDED NUMBER — every numeric option carries an explicit ceiling; `Infinity`, `NaN`, a
 *     float and a negative are all refused. An option whose value is unbounded is a DoS knob.
 *
 * WHAT IT PRODUCES: a null-prototype, frozen record built ONCE. Every downstream read is from that
 * record, never from the caller's object, so there is no second read to disagree with the first —
 * the TOCTOU class disappears rather than being defended against. `document` fields arrive as bytes
 * and are decoded ONCE here, so a downstream reader can never re-decode a caller's buffer that has
 * been mutated in the meantime.
 *
 * Like every other boundary in this kernel: it never throws. A failure is a returned reason.

// `node:util`'s `types` was the last LIVE builtin ESM import binding outside `src/intrinsics.ts`.

 * `boolean` — a flag. `count` — a non-negative safe integer with a mandatory ceiling.
 * `document` — bytes or text, decoded once (a signed/verified artifact supplied as configuration,
 * e.g. the keyring or the checkpoint). `nested` — a sub-object validated by its OWN schema, in the
 * same pass, by this function.
 *
 * ── WHY `nested` VALIDATES HERE AND NOT AT THE CALL SITE (fixed 2026-07-28) ──────────────────────
 * The first version of this file stored the caller's nested object into the inert record unchanged
 * and documented that "the inner `inertOptions` call the caller makes does the rest". Both call
 * sites did make that call, so the code was correct — and the CONTROL was not, because nothing
 * enforced it. A schema author adding `{ kind: "nested" }` and then reading `admitted.value.freshness
 * .now` directly would have read a live caller getter inside the boundary, with no gate objecting.
 * That is the H-03 shape exactly: a rule that holds because the current authors happened to follow
 * it. The validator now owns the inner pass, so forgetting it is not expressible.
 *
 * DEPTH IS BOUNDED AT ONE, MECHANICALLY. A `nested` field's schema may not itself declare a `nested`
 * field; `inertOptions` rejects such a schema at the first call rather than recursing. An exact
 * schema whose depth is unbounded is not an exact schema.
