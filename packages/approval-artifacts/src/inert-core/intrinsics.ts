/**
 * PRISTINE INTRINSICS — the builtins this library uses, captured at module load, before any
 * caller-supplied value has ever been read.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, AS A CLASS. Reading a hostile object necessarily RUNS the attacker's code: a
 * getter, a Proxy trap, a `toJSON`. There is no way to read data out of a live JS object without
 * giving the attacker a turn. Every review of this branch closed one thing the attacker could do
 * during that turn and left the others:
 *
 *   • freeze the data          → the attacker poisons the PROTOTYPE the frozen data still inherits;
 *   • fix one mutable Set      → the mutable Sets in the next file over are untouched;
 *   • route three entry points → the fourth and fifth are not routed;
 *   • add a pre-side-effect marker → the marker is forgeable.
 *
 * The invariant underneath all four is the same: **trusted code decided something by calling a
 * method it did not own.** `allowed.includes(verdict)` is a policy decision that dispatches through
 * the globally-mutable `Array.prototype.includes`. `seen.has(pubkey)` is a witness-distinctness
 * decision that dispatches through the globally-mutable `Set.prototype.has`. Both collections are
 * OURS — frozen, module-private, built from literals — and both were still attacker-controlled,
 * because membership was resolved through a shared mutable slot the attacker could rewrite while we
 * were reading their input.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS. Every builtin the verifier core needs, read ONCE at module-evaluation time
 * into a module-private binding, and re-exported as a plain function that calls it through a
 * captured `Reflect.apply`. After this file has been evaluated, `Array.prototype.includes = () =>
 * true` is inert against every call site that goes through `arrayIncludes`: the poisoned property is
 * simply never consulted again.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BUYS, EXACTLY. ES module evaluation is depth-first over the import graph and completes
 * before ANY exported function can be called, so no caller-supplied value can have been read — and
 * therefore no attacker code can have run — before these bindings are taken. That is a real property
 * and it is worth having: it defeats every poison installed AFTER we load.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS ONLY THAT. A poison installed BEFORE we load is the value this file snapshots, and a
 * snapshot of a lie is a lie that can no longer be repaired.
 *
 * ── CORRECTED IN PLACE 2026-07-30 (this paragraph used to be the defect) ────────────────────────
 * What stood here called the pre-load window "the ONE residual … a HOST application … outside this
 * library's boundary", and pointed at THREAT-MODEL.md as though the matter were filed. It was the
 * stalest text in the security core: ADR-0002 §3 — ratified by the project owner 2026-07-29 — names these
 * exact lines as one of the two places carrying that framing and rejects it. THREAT-MODEL.md,
 * README.md and NON-CLAIMS.md (NC-6.0) were corrected the same day. This file was not, so the
 * docstring a developer reads WHILE EDITING the capture list went on telling them the hole was
 * narrow and somebody else's. It is neither:
 *
 *   "The residual as written sounds narrow. It is not. It is equivalent to: anything sharing the
 *    realm, evaluated in any order we do not control, by any dependency, in any bundler output,
 *    under any test harness that loads a shim first."   — ADR-0002 §3
 *
 * MEASURED, and re-runnable rather than asserted: `test/security/r7-exploits/o01_preload_includes.mjs`
 * is `c02_includes425.mjs` with ONE variable changed — WHEN the poison installs. After-load, the
 * capture holds and the corpus pins it CLOSED. Pre-load, the SAME forged document that is UNTRUSTED
 * clean verifies `VALID` with `signaturesVerified: true`, and the corpus pins it OPEN because it is
 * not fixed and must not come to look fixed.
 *
 * So: this module raises the cost of an in-realm attack. It is not a boundary, it does not become one
 * by growing, and the security property is re-established by process isolation (the Go kernel,
 * ADR-0002), which shares no realm with the caller.
 *
 * ⚠ SCOPE OF WHAT THIS FILE ACHIEVES (2026-07-29, ratified withdrawal — see NON-CLAIMS.md NC-6.0).
 * This module makes an in-realm attack expensive. It does NOT make it impossible, and the package no
 * longer claims otherwise. Four cross-vendor adversarial rounds each closed the sites a review named
 * and each found the same class one call further out, every time while the gates were green — because
 * in a shared realm the set of operations trusted code performs is not enumerable by that trusted
 * code. Security-critical verdicts belong to the isolated Go kernel (ADR-0002). Read the property
 * asserted below as a best-effort hardening target, not as a guarantee this file can keep.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE MECHANICAL. In the trusted verifier core, a decision is NEVER
 * taken by calling a method looked up on a value. It is taken by calling one of these functions.
 * `test/security/intrinsic-poisoning.test.ts` enforces it end to end: it poisons each intrinsic in
 * turn and re-runs every verifier entry point over every fixture, requiring that no poison can turn
 * a rejection into an acceptance. A future call site that reaches for `x.includes(...)` on a
 * decision path turns that suite red without anyone having to remember this docstring.

/**
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN `intrinsics.ts` AND NOT IN `inert.ts` ANY MORE.
 *
 * Round 3 re-rooted every array the PARSER emits, and round 4 found the class one call further out:
 * `objectKeys`, `objectGetOwnPropertyNames`, `ownKeys`, `arraySlice`, `strSplit` and friends
 * MANUFACTURE A FRESH ORDINARY ARRAY on every call, and a fresh ordinary array is rooted on the live
 * `Array.prototype`. So `for (const k of objectKeys(obj))` walked a brand-new poisonable array even
 * though every function in the expression was a captured wrapper. Measured, all on byte-identical
 * input: `noExtraKeys` DENY/policy-invalid -> ALLOW/allow-x (2 hits), the identity manifest
 * MALFORMED -> VALID (1 hit), the checkpoint closed-schema walk TAMPERED -> VALID/tailChecked:true
 * (2 hits), the COSE manifest walk rejected -> ok (1 hit).
 *
 * The lesson the previous three rounds keep re-teaching is that fixing the CALL SITES produces a
 * longer list, not a closed class: the next author writes the next `for…of` over the next captured
 * helper and the class is open again. So the copy happens at the point of CREATION instead. Every
 * wrapper below that manufactures an array hands back an INERT-ROOTED one, which makes the safe
 * behaviour the DEFAULT for call sites that do not exist yet.
 *
 * It has to be HERE rather than in `inert.ts` for a mechanical reason: `inert.ts` imports this
 * module, so the reverse import would be a cycle whose evaluation order puts the captured `const`s
 * in TDZ while `inert.ts`'s module-level construction is running. `inert.ts` re-exports the binding,
 * so every existing importer is unaffected.
 *
 * The construction below is byte-identical in behaviour to the one that used to live in `inert.ts`,
 * INCLUDING the refusal to copy accessor descriptors (the review-#6 defect that was resurrected
 * inside its own fix). It uses the raw captured `_apply(...)` forms rather than the exported
 * wrappers, because the wrappers re-root through the very prototype this IIFE is building.

 * THE PUBLICATION BOUNDARY — the ONE sanctioned way an inert array becomes an ordinary one.
 *
 * Everything above makes inert the DEFAULT for arrays this module manufactures, which is the whole
 * point of A1: a call site that does not exist yet is protected without its author knowing. But an
 * inert array is observably different from an ordinary one in two ways a CALLER can see —
 * `x instanceof Array` is false, and `assert.deepStrictEqual(x, ["a"])` fails on the prototype —
 * and `noa-receipt` is a published package whose documented signatures say `string[]`.
 *
 * So a value that leaves the kernel as a CALLER-OWNED RESULT is copied back onto the real
 * `Array.prototype` here, explicitly and by name. The security property is not weakened by this:
 * inertness protects the array the KERNEL ITERATES WHILE TAKING A VERDICT, and by the time a result
 * is published the verdict has already been taken over the inert copy. What the caller then does
 * with its own array is the caller's business.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS IS NOT, stated so the next author cannot mistake them:
 *   • It is NOT a way to hand an ordinary array BACK INTO the kernel. It is called on the way OUT,
 *     at a `return` in a public entry point, and nowhere else.
 *   • It does NOT apply to PARSER output. `safeParse` and the CBOR decoder deliberately publish
 *     INERT arrays (T19) — that is a documented, tested decision, asserted directly in
 *     `test/safe-json.test.ts`, and it is not reversed here.
