/**
 * INERT DATA — values that inherit from nothing an attacker can reach, and policy tables that cannot
 * be built mutable in the first place.
 *
 * TWO CLASSES, ONE ROOT CAUSE. The fifth review found a mutable `Set` in a frozen policy table
 * (`Object.freeze` does not disable `Set.prototype.add`); the sixth found the same defect in the
 * file next door, plus a NEW variant — a frozen array that still inherits the globally-mutable
 * `Array.prototype`, so poisoning `Array.prototype.includes` made the frozen `["DEFERRED"]` policy
 * row answer `true` to everything. Hand-freezing the tables a review happened to name closes neither
 * class; the next table added by the next change is mutable again, and the frozen ones still
 * inherit.
 *
 * This module removes both possibilities at the point of CONSTRUCTION:
 *
 *   • `INERT_ARRAY_PROTOTYPE` — a frozen, null-rooted prototype carrying PRISTINE copies of the
 *     non-mutating `Array.prototype` methods plus a self-contained iterator. A snapshot array gets
 *     this instead of `Array.prototype`, so `snap.includes(...)`, `for (const x of snap)` and
 *     `[...snap]` all keep working and NONE of them can be redirected by mutating a global. There is
 *     no mutator on it at all, so `push`/`sort`/`splice` are not merely frozen-out, they are absent.
 *
 *   • `frozenSet(...)` — a membership table with no `Set` in it. Its `has` is an own closure over a
 *     private array, resolved with a pristine `indexOf`. `Object.freeze` genuinely freezes it,
 *     because there is nothing inside whose mutators bypass freezing.
 *
 *   • `frozenTable(...)` — deep-freezes a policy table AND REFUSES, at construction time, to accept
 *     anything that could later be mutated: a `Set`, a `Map`, a `Date`, a class instance, a function.
 *     A table that would have been mutable does not become a frozen-looking mutable table; it throws
 *     on the module's very first evaluation, in every process that imports it, including the build.
 *     That is the "cannot be forgotten for the next table" property: the next table either goes
 *     through here or is caught by `policy-tables-inert` (which walks every export of every entry
 *     point and requires the same invariant of values that never came through this file).

 * `INERT_ARRAY_PROTOTYPE` and the `MUTATORS` list it is built from now live in `src/intrinsics.ts`,
 * and this module RE-EXPORTS the binding so every existing importer is unchanged.
 *
 * The move is not tidying. Round 4 measured the iterator/HOF class one call further out than round 3
 * closed it: the captured wrappers `objectKeys`, `objectGetOwnPropertyNames`, `ownKeys`, `arraySlice`
 * and `strSplit` MANUFACTURE a fresh ordinary array on every call, and a fresh ordinary array is
 * rooted on the live `Array.prototype`. Making those wrappers hand back inert-rooted arrays is the
 * fix, and a wrapper cannot re-root through a prototype defined in a module that imports it — the
 * cycle would leave the captured `const`s in TDZ while this file's module-level construction ran.
 * So the prototype moved DOWN to the capture module, which imports nothing.
 *
 * Its construction — including the refusal to copy accessor descriptors — is unchanged; see the
 * docstring at the construction site in `src/intrinsics.ts`.

 *     parsed data dispatches through the array's prototype, so re-rooting is what removes the
 *     attacker's slot. That is delivered here in full.
 *
 *   • freezing delivers nothing against THIS threat model — the parsed array is a fresh object the
 *     adversary holds no reference to; a prototype poison is a poison of the SHARED slot, not of our

 *
 * Measured, not assumed: with this prototype a poisoned `Array.prototype.forEach` / `[Symbol.iterator]`
 * is not consulted, `Array.isArray` still answers true, and `JSON.stringify` is unchanged. What DOES
 * change, and is asserted directly in `test/safe-json.test.ts` rather than left to be discovered:

/**
 * ADR §5.5's membership primitive, and the strongest form available: **a direct own-property probe
 * on a frozen null-prototype table.**
 *
 * `frozenSet` above is already unpoisonable — its `has` is an own closure over a pristine `indexOf`.
 * This is stronger in two further ways that matter for the TCB's hottest paths:
 *
 *   1. NO METHOD IS CALLED ON THE TABLE AT ALL. `frozenSet(...).has(x)` still READS the property
 *      `has` off a value before invoking it. That read is safe here because the object is frozen and
 *      null-rooted, but "safe because of what this particular object is" is the reasoning that lost
 *      four rounds in a row. `hasOwn(TABLE, x)` reads no property off the table; it passes the table
 *      as an argument to a `hasOwnProperty` captured at module load.
 *   2. IT IS MECHANICALLY VISIBLE. `scripts/lint-security-gates.mjs` L2 bans the TEXT `.has(` on a
 *      TCB decision path, because a source lint cannot know whether a receiver is a `Set` or a
 *      `frozenSet`. A primitive that reads correct AND lints clean is the one that survives the next
 *      author, who will not have read this comment.
 *
 * The table is null-prototype, so `Object.prototype` pollution cannot forge a member (C-03's class),
 * and frozen, so nothing can widen it after load (the `Set.prototype.add` class from reviews #5/#6).

 * The previous version froze the table and LEFT IT ROOTED ON `Object.prototype`. Freezing an object
 * says nothing about what it INHERITS, and a policy table is read by membership tests
 * (`spec in TABLE`) and indexed reads (`TABLE[spec]`) — both of which walk the prototype chain.
 * `c03_frozentable_proto.mjs` defined ONE property on `Object.prototype` and the frozen `ARTIFACTS`
 * registry answered with it: an unsigned, unregistered artifact verified `{ok:true}` against a
 * table nobody had modified. Nothing about the table changed, which is exactly why freezing it
 * could not help.
 *
 * A null-rooted table has no chain to walk. `TABLE[x]` is `undefined` for every `x` that is not an
 * own property, whatever `Object.prototype` says. That is the structural form of the control; the
 * own-property probes at the call sites are the belt to this pair of braces.
