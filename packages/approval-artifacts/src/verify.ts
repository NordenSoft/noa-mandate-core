/**
 * The generic, context-aware side-artifact verifier — the reference logic the §6 conformance
 * vectors are run against, and the shared core a real gate / phone (D2) / `verify-evidence` (§13)
 * consumer builds on. It is deliberately fail-closed: a check it cannot positively satisfy REJECTS.
 *
 * A verification is the AND of five independent layers, each of which a rejection vector is designed
 * to trip exactly one of:
 *   1. STRUCTURAL   — the shipped schema/<spec>.schema.json (additionalProperties:false, enums,
 *                     patterns, discriminated pairing union). Catches `unknown-property` + shape.
 *   2. SIGNATURE    — for signed artifacts: sig.kid resolves in the keyring, the key is not revoked
 *                     (a non-null revokedAt is refused outright), holds the F15 role, and the Ed25519 signature over
 *                     `<DOMAIN>: ++ SHA256(JCS(doc without sig))` verifies. Catches `tampered-content`
 *                     + `wrong-key`.
 *   3. REFHASH      — every declared cross-artifact `*Hash` equals the F1-correct hash (rule a/b/c) of
 *                     the referenced artifact. Catches `cross-artifact-hash-substitution` (+ the
 *                     transitive-tenant realization for tenant-less artifacts, F7b/G7).
 *   4. EQUALS       — declared field equalities (tenant, nonce, pinned ids, sig.kid ↔ self-kid).
 *                     Catches `wrong-tenant` / `wrong-nonce` where the artifact carries the field.
 *   5. TIME         — expiry (`mustBeAfter`) + freshness-window (`mustBeWithin`). Catches `expired`.

 * ── P0-6 (2026-07-31): `Date.parse` IS NOT A SECURITY PARSER ──────────────────────────────────
 * This returned `pristineDateParse(v)` for any string. `Date.parse` does not reject malformed
 * input — it NORMALISES it into a plausible instant, and every comparison below then treats that
 * invented instant as the declared one. MEASURED end to end against the shipped decision vector,
 * with the unmodified vector ACCEPTED in the same run as the control:
 *
 *     validFrom "0"            -> Date.parse => 1999-12-31  -> key ACCEPTED (a past instant)
 *     validFrom "2026-02-30"   -> Date.parse => 2026-03-02  -> key ACCEPTED (the day does not exist)
 *     validFrom "" / "   " / not-a-timestamp -> NaN          -> refused, as intended
 *
 * So an operator who declares a FUTURE activation and mistypes it gets a key that is silently
 * active already. (An attacker who can author the key record gains nothing they did not already
 * have — this is an operator-error amplifier, not an authorization bypass, and it is recorded at
 * that severity rather than inflated.)
 *
 * The parser is now STRICT: calendar validity plus the epoch value are computed directly from the
 * numeric components. Its lexical grammar is NOT restated here: it evaluates the shipped artifact
 * schema's `$defs.rfc3339` rule, so lowercase `t`/`z`, 1-9 fractional digits, and numeric offsets
 * accepted by the published schema reach the semantic parser. Nanoseconds are retained as an exact
 * bigint so two schema-valid instants inside the same millisecond still compare in the right order.
 * It does not call `Date` or any `Date` method; the test "P0-9: a targeted
 * Date.prototype.toISOString poison cannot admit a non-existent activation date" installs the
 * targeted poison while pinning both refusal and an accepted control.
 *
 * Batch N corrected the compatibility measurement. The earlier scan found no non-canonical values
 * in the repository corpus, but the compatibility surface is the published schema, not that corpus
 * or the canonical form emitted here. Real re-signed Decisions using lowercase `t`/`z` and 1-9
 * fractional digits reproduced the regression; those spellings are permanent tests now.
 *
 * Fixed HERE rather than in a separate activation-only parser, deliberately: all 11 comparisons in
 * this file are security comparisons, and giving activation its own parser would create exactly the
 * resolver drift this batch exists to close.

 * Review #6's C2 was found here: the function validated the schema and the signature and then
 * RE-READ the live artifact for the equality and time checks, so a getter that returned the signed
 * `approverKid` on reads 1-3 and `attacker-seat` on the equality read made a context REQUIRING
 * `attacker-seat` return `{ok:true}` — the signer never attested the value the verifier accepted.
 * The tell was that two equality assertions with CONTRADICTORY expected values both passed in one
 * call, which no inert object can do.
 *
 * The previous fix snapshotted the artifact AND the context — but deliberately EXCLUDED
 * `ctx.schemas` on a cost argument. That exclusion was the remaining hole, and it is the one C-03
 * went through: `ctx.schemas[spec]` on a plain `{}` resolves through `Object.prototype`, so a single
 * pollution supplied a permissive schema for an unregistered spec. Snapshotting the subject and
 * leaving one member of the policy live is the same defect one argument to the left, which is
 * exactly what the earlier comment said about `ctx` — and then it made an exception.
 *
 * There is now no exception, because there is no traversal: both arguments are decoded and parsed by
 * the same strict parser the kernel uses, and everything below reads `safeParse` output —
 * null-prototype, accessor-free, duplicate-key-free, depth-bounded. `ctx.schemas` is JSON (it is a
 * set of JSON Schema documents), so making it bytes costs a parse of a few kilobytes per call and
 * removes the last live object from the boundary.
 *
 * Never throws: every failure is a returned `{ok:false, reason}`.
