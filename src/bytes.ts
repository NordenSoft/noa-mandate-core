/**
 * THE BYTE BOUNDARY — the ONE place a security-sensitive document enters the kernel.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every previous boundary in this repository tried to make a caller-owned
 * JavaScript object safe to traverse. That is the wrong shape of problem: reading a live object
 * necessarily runs the attacker's code (a getter, a Proxy trap, a `toJSON`), so each round closed
 * one thing the attacker could do during that turn and left the others. `ingest.ts` was 260 lines
 * of increasingly precise defence against a turn the attacker should never have been given.
 *
 * Bytes have no getters, no traps, no prototype chain, and no identity that can differ between two
 * reads. A `Uint8Array` read twice yields the same bytes both times, by construction rather than by
 * discipline. So the kernel takes bytes, decodes them ONCE under a hard bound, and hands the text
 * to `safeParse`, which already produces a null-prototype, duplicate-key-free, depth-bounded,
 * accessor-free tree. The class-A attack surface is not mitigated here — it ceases to exist,
 * because the objects it requires are never constructed inside the boundary.
 *
 * THREE RULES, and each closes something a naive `TextDecoder` call would leave open:
 *
 *   1. THE BOUND IS ON BYTES, BEFORE THE DECODE. `safeParse`'s `maxLength` is a property of an
 *      already-materialised string, so bounding only there means a 400 MB input is fully decoded
 *      into a 400 MB string before anyone objects. With a `Uint8Array` primary the ceiling has to
 *      be checked on `byteLength` FIRST or bytes-in would REGRESS DoS posture relative to the
 *      object API. `MAX_INPUT_BYTES` is that check (ADR §3.4, the ADR's one new normative rule).
 *
 *   2. THE DECODE IS FATAL AND BOM-PRESERVING. `fatal: true` rejects overlong encodings, truncated
 *      sequences and WTF-8 lone surrogates instead of silently substituting U+FFFD — substitution
 *      is a forgery channel, because two different byte strings would hash the same after it.
 *      `ignoreBOM: true` means "do not strip a leading U+FEFF", so a BOM survives into `safeParse`
 *      and is rejected there as an unexpected character. A decoder that silently deletes a leading
 *      byte is a decoder that accepts two different documents as one.
 *
 *   3. THE TYPE TEST USES AN INTERNAL SLOT, NOT A PROPERTY. `instanceof` consults
 *      `Symbol.hasInstance` and walks a prototype chain; `Object.prototype.toString` consults
 *      `Symbol.toStringTag`; a `byteLength` property read can hit a subclass accessor. All three
 *      are attacker-writable. The `%TypedArray%.prototype` `Symbol.toStringTag` and `byteLength`
 *      getters read the object's internal slots and cannot be spoofed by any property an attacker
 *      can define — the tag getter returns `undefined` for a non-typed-array rather than throwing,
 *      which is exactly the total, trap-free predicate this boundary needs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE NEVER DOES: throw. Every failure is a returned reason, because a
 * security-sensitive entry point that throws hands the caller an exception object whose own
 * `message` getter is attacker-reachable (ADR §3.5).

 * no floats or exponents, no unsafe integers, no lone surrogates, no unescaped control characters,
 * no trailing content, and bounded depth.
 *
 * That list is not restated here and is not re-implemented here. It is `src/safe-json.ts`, which is

 * strict parser for the new boundary would create a second normative text and turn any drift between
 * them into an interop break across TS/Py/Go/Rust/C#. The parser has been correct the whole time.
 * The defect this migration fixes is that the OBJECT API ROUTED AROUND IT: `verifyChain(obj)` never
 * called `safeParse`, so none of its guarantees applied, and `ingest`/`inert`/`intrinsics` were an
 * attempt to reconstruct over a live hostile object the properties the parser already provided for
 * free over bytes.
 *
 * Reading `e.message` here is safe in a way it would not be for an arbitrary caught value, and the
 * safety is established by the BRAND rather than by the read: `isSafeJsonError` is a `WeakSet`
 * identity lookup that fires no trap for any input, and a `true` answer certifies the message was
 * built from `safe-json.ts`'s own literals plus a numeric position. Anything else gets a fixed
