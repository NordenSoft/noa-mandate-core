/**
 * `noa.action-digest/0.1` — THE ONE INTEROPERABLE CORRELATION VALUE FOR AN AUTHORIZED ACTION.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS, STATED AS THE DEFECT IT CLOSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two planes disagreed, silently, and both were schema-legal. The kernel defines `action.id` as a
 * TOOL IDENTIFIER (`src/types.ts` `ReceiptAction.id`, e.g. `deploy.apply`). A downstream consumer
 * compared that same `action.id` against a GRANT HASH and refused the mismatch. The frozen receipt
 * schema types `action.id` as a plain string, so nothing anywhere could detect the contradiction —
 * one side stores a name, the other side expects a hash, and both validate. That is not a bug in
 * either implementation; it is a MISSING SHARED VALUE, and this module is that value.
 *
 * `docs/carlos.md` §3 (recorded 2026-07-23, never superseded; it governs per `OWNER-DECISION-REGISTER`
 * A-3 and ADR-0006 §4.1) is normative on both halves:
 *
 *     "`action.paramsHash` must not be treated as the shared action digest. It does not bind the
 *      complete authorization, tenant/chain, exact attempt, grant, or nonce and may repeat across
 *      retries."
 *
 * and then prescribes exactly this construction, with a frozen projection committing to the
 * recomputed authorization-receipt hash, tenant, chain, `action.id`, `action.canonical`,
 * `action.paramsHash`, the execution grant's id and hash, and a single-use execution nonce.
 *
 * ── THE CONSTRUCTION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     projection = { spec, authorizationReceiptHash, tenant, chain, actionId, actionCanonical,
 *                    actionParamsHash, executionGrantId, executionGrantHash, executionNonce }
 *
 *     digest = "sha256:" ++ hex( SHA256( UTF8("NOA-ActionDigest-v0.1-dig:") ++ SHA256(JCS(projection)) ) )
 *
 * The inner step is `signingMessage()` from `src/signing.ts` — the SAME domain-separation primitive
 * receipts, checkpoints and every §6 side artifact use. It is reused rather than re-invented for the
 * reason this repository keeps re-learning: two implementations of one rule become two rules.
 *
 * THE TAG ENDS IN `-dig`, NOT `-sig`, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Every existing tag names a value that
 * gets Ed25519-SIGNED. This value is HASHED and never signed, so a tag in the signing namespace
 * would invite exactly the cross-protocol confusion domain separation exists to prevent: an
 * Ed25519 signature over `NOA-ActionDigest-v0.1-sig:‖H` would be a signature over a preimage that
 * some other verifier might one day accept. Nothing signs `-dig`.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH (read this before relying on a match) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `carlos.md` §3 again, verbatim: *"Digest equality is linkage/correlation only. It is not proof
 * that a controller or physical claim is true."* Concretely, and each of these is a real limit, not
 * a hedge:
 *
 *   - THE TWO ENTRY POINTS HAVE DIFFERENT TRUST CONTRACTS, and conflating them is the mistake this
 *     paragraph exists to prevent. `verifyActionDigest` AUTHENTICATES ITS OWN INPUTS: it requires a
 *     trust root, runs `verifyChain` over the supplied chain, verifies the grant's Ed25519
 *     signature through `resolveVerificationKey`, and selects the authorization by the grant's own
 *     `approvalReceiptHash`. `buildActionDigest` does NOT: it is the producer-side construction, it
 *     takes a verdict from nobody and returns no verdict, and a caller who feeds it two unverified
 *     documents gets a digest over two unverified documents.
 *
 *     An earlier revision made NEITHER entry point authenticate anything and disclosed that in
 *     prose. Round-2 QA refused it, correctly: a classification string does not enforce call
 *     ordering and does not stop document substitution, and disclosure is not a control on a
 *     surface that authorization decisions rest on.
 *   - WHAT `verifyActionDigest` STILL DOES NOT COVER, stated because a partial check described as a
 *     whole one is worse than no check: the grant's §6 SEMANTICS. The F15 signer type/role matrix,
 *     key activation windows, grant expiry and the envelope refHash chain are `verifyArtifact`'s
 *     (`packages/approval-artifacts/src/verify.ts`), which this package has no dependency edge to.
 *     Signature authenticity is checked here; grant AUTHORIZATION semantics are not.
 *   - IT IS NOT A CAPABILITY. Knowing a digest authorizes nothing; the digest is a public
 *     correlation key, safe to log and to index.
 *   - IT IS NOT PROOF THE ACTION HAPPENED. That is the execution-consumption / physical-observation
 *     layer (`carlos.md` §4), not this one.
 *
 * What it DOES establish, and what makes it strictly stronger than the `paramsHash` comparison it
 * replaces: two parties holding the same authorization receipt and the same execution grant compute
 * the same value, and any party holding a DIFFERENT authorization — different tenant, different
 * chain, different action, different attempt, different grant, different nonce — computes a
 * different one. Everything the verifier below refuses, it refuses because that property would
 * otherwise be false.

 * This module checked shape, self-hash, receipt reference, parameter equality and single-use — and
 * never read `governance.verdict`. So a correctly signed HUMAN DENIAL, wrapped in a correctly
 * gate-signed grant, correlated as an authorization: `verifyChain` VALID, `verifyArtifact` ok,
 * and `ACTION_DIGEST_LINKAGE_MATCHED`. Satisfying both of the spec's preconditions did not save it,
 * because neither precondition asks what the receipt DECIDED.
 *
 * `packages/relay/src/engine.ts` records the same class being caught before — a status plane
 * recording APPROVED over a cryptographically VALID human denial, reproduced. The lesson that did
 * not travel with it is the general one: AUTHENTICITY AND AUTHORIZATION ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS,
 * and every new module that consumes a receipt has to ask the second one for itself. A signature
 * proves who wrote the decision, never which decision they wrote.
 *
 * `ALLOWED` is the whole set on purpose. `BLOCKED` is a denial; `DEFERRED` is a decision not yet
 * made; `EXECUTED`/`FAILED`/`ROLLED_BACK` are outcome records that post-date authorization; and
 * `SIMULATED` is explicitly not a real action. A grant descends from the ALLOWED decision alone —
 * `packages/gate/src/grants.ts` names its own parameter `allowedReceipt`.

  // Round-2 QA was right that a classification string is not a control: the previous shape verified
  // no signature and asked callers, in prose, to do it first. Prose does not enforce call ordering
  // and does not stop document substitution, and the surface carries authorization decisions.
  //
  // The fix composes rather than duplicates. `verifyChain` IS this package's receipt verifier, so
  // calling it creates no second definition of "a valid receipt" — the drift hazard that made
  // re-implementation the wrong answer never arises. The chain (not a lone receipt) is required
  // because a mid-chain receipt cannot be verified alone: measured, `verifyChain([r2])` returns
  // `TAMPERED — seq gap: missing seq 0`, so accepting a single receipt would have forced either a
  // weaker check or a private re-implementation of the chain walk.

  // mint a grant at all: the Ed25519 signature under the grant's own domain tag, with the key
  // resolved by this package's `resolveVerificationKey` — so static maps, lifecycle documents and
  // RETIRED-key refusal all behave exactly as they do everywhere else in the kernel.
  //
  // WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, because claiming it would be worse than not doing it: the
  // F15 signer TYPE/ROLE matrix, key activation windows, grant expiry and the envelope refHash
  // chain are NOT evaluated. A caller enforcing an authorization decision must still run
  // `verifyArtifact`. `docs/action-digest-spec.md` §6 states this as a residual, not as a footnote.
