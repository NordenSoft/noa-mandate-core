/**
 * THE BYTE BOUNDARY, PUBLISHED — because a sibling package had to re-create it, which is the exact
 * drift hazard this file argues against thirty lines below for the inert primitives.
 *
 * `safeParse` was already exported and `decodeDocument`/`parseDocument` were not, so
 * `packages/evidence` — which verifies the same documents under the same rules — reimplemented the
 * byte-ceiling-before-decode and the `fatal:true, ignoreBOM:true` decode itself. Both halves are
 * security mechanism: the ceiling is what stops bytes-in from REGRESSING DoS posture relative to the
 * object API (ADR §3.4's one new normative rule), and the fatal decode is what stops two different
 * byte strings from hashing the same after U+FFFD substitution. A near-copy of either will drift from
 * this one the first time either changes, and then two packages will disagree about what a valid
 * document is while both believe they agree.
 *
 * Exported as UTILITY rather than SECURITY_SENSITIVE for the same reason `safeParse` is: this IS the
 * boundary. Its first parameter is `unknown` BY DESIGN — deciding whether an arbitrary value is a
 * document is the whole job — so demanding it take `Uint8Array | string` would be circular.

/**
 * ── THE INGEST BOUNDARY IS GONE, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE HEADLINE OF THIS RELEASE ─────────────────
 *
 * `snapshotImmutable`, `tryIngest`, `isIngestError`, `IngestError` and `MAX_INGEST_DEPTH` were 260
 * lines whose entire purpose was to make a caller-owned, LIVE JavaScript object safe enough to
 * reason about: fire every getter exactly once, refuse sparse arrays, strip prototypes, re-root onto
 * an inert array prototype, and recognise its own error class through a `WeakSet` brand because
 * `instanceof` is attacker-invocable. Every line of it was correct and every line of it was
 * answering a question the kernel no longer asks. Security changes that DELETE mechanism are the
 * ones that hold up; this is the deletion the whole migration was for.
 *
 * `deepFreeze` survives — it moved to `./inert.js`, where it always belonged. It freezes the
 * MODULE'S OWN constant tables and never touched caller input.
 *
 * The inert-data primitives below survive for the same reason and it is worth stating, because the
 * ADR's own summary table listed them for deletion: they are NOT an input boundary. They construct
 * THIS package's literal policy tables so those tables inherit from nothing an attacker can write to
 * (ADR §5.6), and bytes-in explicitly does not close that class — "bytes-in removes the R7 delivery
 * vehicle; it does not remove the flaw." Deleting them would have removed a control that nothing
 * replaces. They are published because the sibling packages verify the SAME bytes under the SAME
 * class properties, and one implementation is better than five near-copies.
