 * `{ maxReceipts: 10 }` is the ergonomics this API is worth having. What changed is that every
 * member which is a signed or verified DOCUMENT — the keyring, the identity manifest, the
 * checkpoint — is now `Uint8Array | string`, and the object itself is admitted only through
 * `inertOptions`, which rejects a Proxy (before any trap-firing reflection), an accessor, a
 * function, a symbol, an exotic prototype, an unknown member and an unbounded number, then converts
 * what survives ONCE into a frozen null-prototype record.
 *
 * That is what deletes the `structuredClone` machinery this file used to carry. The snapshot existed
 * because the in-process object API read the same caller object more than once and a flipping
 * accessor could show one value to authentication and another to enforcement. After this change
 * there is no caller object to read twice: the receipts came from `safeParse` over bytes, and every
 * option was read exactly once at the boundary. The defence is not improved — its reason to exist
 * is gone.

    // TAMPERED — the same verdict class as the `scope.chain` partition-split check in step 2, since
    // this is the identical class of problem for the sibling scope field.
    // WHICH DRIFTS ARE FATAL. `scope.tenant` is OPTIONAL in the schema and the frozen spec never
    // declared it immutable, so the two kinds of drift are not the same event:
    //
    //   present -> DIFFERENT present   (acme -> globex)  two distinct tenants spliced into one
    //     chain. Every receipt is individually intact and correctly signed; the forgery is a
    //     property of the SET — the identical class as the `scope.chain` partition split above,

    //
    //   absent <-> present             (enrichment/omission)  a deployment that began emitting
    //     (or stopped emitting) an optional field mid-chain. That is a producer-version change,
    //     NOT a cross-tenant splice, and nothing in the frozen spec forbids it. Calling it
    //     TAMPERED would label a legitimate transition as cryptographic tampering, tell the
    //     operator to hunt a forgery that does not exist, and contradict this profile's own
    //     rule that distinct failures must not collapse onto one verdict. Report it instead.
    //
    // ── WHY THE COMPARISON IS NOT ADJACENT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // That relaxation is right in principle and was wrong in its state machine. Comparing only
    // ADJACENT receipts let an omission RESET the boundary: `acme -> globex` was TAMPERED, but
    // `acme -> absent -> globex` — the same splice with one optional field left out of the receipt
    // in between — was VALID, in all five implementations. Dropping an optional field is not a
    // capability an attacker lacks, so the tolerated transition became a laundering step.
    //
    // The state machine therefore carries the LAST PRESENT tenant across absences instead of
    // forgetting it. Absence is still never fatal and is still reported; it simply no longer erases
    // what the chain has already committed to. `acme -> absent -> acme` stays VALID (the same tenant
    // resumes) and `absent -> absent -> acme` stays VALID (a producer that starts emitting the
    // field), which is exactly the legitimacy the relaxation existed to protect.
