/**
 * L2 on-receipt policy-compliance (B4) — wires the deterministic evaluator INTO the receipt.
 *
 * `complianceCommit` produces the three binding hashes a receipt commits (policyHash + readSetHash +
 * inputsHash) PLUS the recorded verdict (re-run at commit time);
 * `verifyReceiptCompliance` is the offline proof: given the policy + the recorded inputs (out-of-band,
 * since inputs may be PII and are NEVER placed raw on the receipt), it confirms those hashes authenticate
 * exactly that policy + those inputs, RE-RUNS the deterministic evaluator, and — when the commitment
 * records a verdict — REQUIRES the re-run verdict to equal the recorded one (else ok:false).
 *
 * Honesty razor: this proves "policy P, re-run over the RECORDED inputs I, yields verdict V, and V equals
 * the decision the receipt recorded" — it is substitution-resistant (a receipt cannot commit DENY-inputs
 * while claiming ALLOW). It is NOT proof the policy was in force at decision time, nor that I is
 * true/complete, nor that P is a good rule.
 *
 * AUTHENTICITY: the L2 check operates on the receipt's `governance.compliance` block, which is
 * attacker-mutable on a NON-authentic receipt. By itself it does NOT establish that the receipt is genuine.
 * The carrier MUST be independently authenticated — either pass `{ keyring }` here (the carrier's own hash
 * + Ed25519 signature are then verified BEFORE the L2 check; a non-authentic carrier ⇒ ok:false), or call
 * `verifyChain([...], { keyring })` and require VALID first. Never report "compliant" off a carrier you
 * have not authenticated. Never throws (fail-closed).
 *
 * ATTRIBUTION: `{ keyring }` carrier-auth is KID-LEVEL — it proves "a keyring-trusted key
 * signed this carrier", NOT "THIS agent.id signed it". In a multi-key keyring a co-trusted key can sign a
 * receipt claiming `agent.id=victim` and still pass carrier-auth (ok:true), exactly the cross-agent
 * impersonation `verifyChain` rejects as UNTRUSTED only when given an identityManifest. To get the same
 * attribution guarantee here, ALSO pass `{ identityManifest }`: the carrier's `(agent.id, sig.kid)` pairing
 * is then required to be authorized (mirrors verify.ts 4c-bis) — an unauthorized pairing ⇒ ok:false. Without
 * an identityManifest, L2 attribution stays kid-level (the weaker, documented guarantee).
