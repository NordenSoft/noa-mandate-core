/**
 * verifyChainWitnessed — the OPT-IN composition of (1) the unchanged offline receipt-chain verifier and
 * (2) the §4 witness-acceptance rule, returned as one honestly-named result.
 *
 * This writes NO new cryptography. It calls the existing `verifyChain` / `verifyChainText` UNCHANGED for the
 * offline chain integrity check (hash-chain, signatures, key-pinning, checkpoint tail-match — all the v0.1
 * properties, untouched), then applies the existing `verifyCompleteness` (acceptance.ts) to a
 * caller-supplied snapshot of witness anchors over the chain's presented head. The default receipt-verify
 * flow is unaffected: a caller that never imports this sees identical behavior.
 *
 * HONEST SCOPE (federation-spec §4 point 3 / §7 / §10): the chain still verifies OFFLINE; the witness step is
 * a SNAPSHOT check over anchors the caller already collected — it does NOT contact a live witness or fetch a
 * current frontier (that WIRE layer is dormant, §10). So `witness.complete === true` (QUORUM_CONFIRMED) means
 * "a quorum of pinned witnesses confirmed THIS head as of the supplied snapshot" — read `witness.scope` +
 * `witness.note`; it is not an unqualified non-deletion assertion. The two results are returned SEPARATELY
 * (never merged into one boolean) so a caller cannot mistake a witnessed-but-tampered chain for an accepted
 * one, or a valid chain with an unmet quorum for a complete one.
