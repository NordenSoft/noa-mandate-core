/**
 * Witness-federation ACCEPTANCE RULE — reference verifier (offline; network WIRE layer dormant).
 *
 * This implements docs/federation-spec.md §4 ("Anchors and the acceptance rule") as a PURE,
 * offline-checkable function over a set of witness anchors the caller has already collected. It is the
 * REFERENCE verifier for the witness layer, now reachable through an OPT-IN, disjoint path: the anchor
 * builder (src/federation/anchor.ts), the composed witnessed-verify entry (src/federation/verify-witnessed.ts),
 * the `noa verify --anchors/--trust-set` CLI flags, and the src/index.ts exports. The DEFAULT receipt-verify
 * flow (src/verify.ts verifyChain) is unchanged and never calls this. The network WIRE layer — live witness
 * frontier queries and inclusion/consistency Merkle proofs — remains DORMANT per federation-spec §10:
 * nothing here (or on the opt-in path) contacts a witness or a network; the caller supplies the anchor
 * snapshot out-of-band.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT CHECK (honest scope — see federation-spec §7):
 *  - It checks the **non-deletion acceptance rule** of §4 over a caller-supplied snapshot of witness
 *    answers (anchors). The verifier is sovereign (§2.2): the caller PINS the trust-set (k witnesses +
 *    quorum q) out-of-band, exactly as the receipt keyring is pinned out-of-band.
 *  - It does NOT contact witnesses, fetch frontiers, or validate inclusion/consistency Merkle proofs —
 *    those are the (gated) wire layer (federation-spec §10). The caller presents each witness's latest
 *    answered anchor; this function applies the §4 classification + quorum rule to that snapshot.
 *  - It does NOT verify the receipt chain itself (that is verifyChain, offline, unchanged — §4 point 3).
 *  - The FROST federation root does NOT sign anchors (§5): anchors are signed by each witness's OWN key.
 *    A caller MUST pin witness keys, not the root; this function only ever verifies an anchor signature
 *    against a pinned WITNESS pubkey and never treats a root signature as an anchor.
 *
 * Reuses the receipt path's Ed25519 primitive (src/keys.ts verifyEd25519: curve-pinned, canonical-SPKI,
 * small-order/non-canonical-y rejected, strict-canonical base64) so an anchor signature is held to the
 * exact same cross-impl-consensus strictness as a receipt/checkpoint signature.

 * confirm does not count toward q (it becomes STALE). With no policy, currency is NOT enforced and is the
