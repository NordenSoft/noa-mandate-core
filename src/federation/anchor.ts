/**
 * Witness-anchor BUILDER — the producer side of the (OPT-IN) witness-federation layer.
 *
 * An anchor is the federation generalisation of a v0.1 checkpoint (docs/federation-spec.md §4): it binds
 * a witness to an exact receipt-chain frontier {chain, highestSeq, headHash, ts}, co-signed by the
 * WITNESS's own key rather than a keyring key. This module mints such anchors; src/federation/acceptance.ts
 * verifies them. The two are held to ONE preimage: `buildAnchor` signs EXACTLY the bytes
 * `anchorSigningInput` (acceptance.ts) reconstructs to verify — the JCS of {chain, highestSeq, headHash, ts},
 * domain-tagged with ANCHOR_SIG_DOMAIN — so a freshly built anchor round-trips through the acceptance rule
 * bit-for-bit. There is no second crypto path here: this file only composes the receipt package's existing
 * Ed25519 signer (src/keys.ts) with that shared preimage.
 *
 * SCOPE (honesty, federation-spec §7/§10): this is the offline, file-based producer. It mints an anchor a
 * witness would sign; it does NOT run a witness, contact a network, or build inclusion/consistency Merkle
 * proofs — that WIRE layer stays dormant (§10). An anchor is a witness's co-signature over a snapshot
 * frontier, not an unqualified non-deletion assertion.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED, mirroring builder.ts (buildReceipt/buildCheckpoint): a caller-supplied frontier is
 * structurally validated BEFORE anything is signed (a missing / wrong-type / malformed field throws
 * `AnchorError`, never signs garbage), and the fully-built anchor is re-validated against the exact
 * structural rules acceptance.ts enforces per anchor immediately before it is returned — so a signed anchor
 * the reference verifier would drop as malformed can never escape this builder.
