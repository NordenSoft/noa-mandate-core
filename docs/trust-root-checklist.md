# Production key management — a practical checklist

Everything a NOA Receipt proves collapses to one sentence: **the keyring (and, if you use one,
the identity manifest) is the root of trust.** Get that wrong and every "VALID" is meaningless.
This is the one-page version of "how do I actually run this in production" — the full reasoning
is in [THREAT-MODEL.md](../THREAT-MODEL.md) and [`docs/receipt-spec.md`](receipt-spec.md) §5–§6;
read those before you rely on any of this.

## 1. Generate a signing key per agent identity

```js
import { generateKeyPair } from "noa-receipt";

const kp = generateKeyPair("agent-prod-key-1"); // kid: any string you'll recognize later
// kp.publicKey  -> base64 SPKI, goes in the keyring
// kp.privateKey -> base64 PKCS8, keep secret
```

One `kid` per key. Give each agent/service its own key rather than sharing one across agents —
a shared key means a keyring compromise or a rogue caller can author receipts for *every* agent
that uses it.

## 2. Never let the private key touch a receipt, a repo, or a log

`kp.privateKey` is a secret, full stop — [`src/keys.ts`](../src/keys.ts) says so at the type
definition. Load it from an env var, a secrets manager, or (for anything that matters) a
KMS/HSM that never exports the raw key material. It is never part of the signed receipt body —
only `sig.kid` (which key signed) and `sig.value` (the signature) are.

## 3. Build the keyring, distribute it out-of-band

```js
import { generateKeyPair } from "noa-receipt";

const kp = generateKeyPair("agent-prod-key-1");
const keyring = { [kp.kid]: kp.publicKey }; // kid -> base64 SPKI public key
```

This object is the trust root every verifier needs (`verifyChain(receipts, { keyring })`). It
must reach verifiers through a channel you trust *independently of the receipts themselves* —
e.g. a signed manifest file you publish and checksum, your own config-management/secrets
pipeline, or plain trust-on-first-use for a low-stakes deployment. Whatever you pick, write it
down: an attacker who can also rewrite your keyring distribution channel owns the whole system.

## 4. Bind `agent.id` to its key with an `identityManifest`

A keyring alone proves *"a trusted key signed this"* — not *which* agent. If more than one key
is ever trusted, any holder of any trusted key can author a fully `VALID` chain that asserts
someone else's `agent.id`. Close that with an `identityManifest`:

```js
import { generateKeyPair, buildReceipt, verifyChain } from "noa-receipt";

const kp = generateKeyPair("agent-prod-key-1");
const signer = { kid: kp.kid, privateKey: kp.privateKey };
const keyring = { [kp.kid]: kp.publicKey };
const identityManifest = { "billing-agent-7": [kp.kid] }; // agent.id -> authorized kid(s)

const receipt = buildReceipt(
  {
    id: "rcpt_0",
    ts: new Date().toISOString(),
    scope: { chain: "checklist:demo" },
    agent: { id: "billing-agent-7", model: "vendor/model-v1", principal: "SERVICE" },
    action: {
      id: "payment.refund",
      canonical: "payment.refund",
      riskClass: "LOW",
      paramsHash: "sha256:" + "0".repeat(64), // never carry raw params — only their hash
      reversible: false,
      rollbackRef: null,
    },
    governance: { mode: "on", verdict: "EXECUTED", ruleId: "low-risk-auto", approval: null, sandboxed: false },
  },
  null, // no previous receipt: this is the genesis of the chain
  signer,
);

const result = verifyChain([receipt], { keyring, identityManifest });
console.log(result.status); // -> "VALID"
// an unauthorized (agent.id, sig.kid) pairing instead -> status: "UNTRUSTED", not "TAMPERED"
```

Skip this only for a single-key keyring, where the ambiguity can't arise. Details:
[receipt-spec.md](receipt-spec.md) §5, step 5b.

## 5. Pin the head with a signed checkpoint

`prevHash` catches an edited *past* record but not a deleted *recent* one — a verifier handed a
truncated prefix still sees `VALID`. A checkpoint closes that:

```js
import { generateKeyPair, buildReceipt, buildCheckpoint, verifyChain } from "noa-receipt";

const kp = generateKeyPair("agent-prod-key-1");
const signer = { kid: kp.kid, privateKey: kp.privateKey }; // the chain's opener key — see step 6
const keyring = { [kp.kid]: kp.publicKey };
const identityManifest = { "billing-agent-7": [kp.kid] };

const latestReceipt = buildReceipt(
  {
    id: "rcpt_0",
    ts: new Date().toISOString(),
    scope: { chain: "checklist:demo" },
    agent: { id: "billing-agent-7", model: "vendor/model-v1", principal: "SERVICE" },
    action: {
      id: "payment.refund",
      canonical: "payment.refund",
      riskClass: "LOW",
      paramsHash: "sha256:" + "0".repeat(64),
      reversible: false,
      rollbackRef: null,
    },
    governance: { mode: "on", verdict: "EXECUTED", ruleId: "low-risk-auto", approval: null, sandboxed: false },
  },
  null, // genesis: this receipt also opens the chain, so `signer` is the opener key here
  signer,
);

const checkpoint = buildCheckpoint(latestReceipt, new Date().toISOString(), signer);
const result = verifyChain([latestReceipt], { keyring, identityManifest, checkpoint });
console.log(result.status, result.tailChecked); // -> "VALID" true
```

Sign checkpoints with the **private key that corresponds to the `kid` which signed the chain's
genesis (`seq == 0`) receipt for that `agent.id`** — colloquially "the opener key", but it is a
*key*, not the `agent.id` string itself. That's the key `verifyChain` checks a checkpoint's
authority against when an `identityManifest` is supplied, and it's what stops a co-trusted key
from re-heading the chain and forging a checkpoint over its own truncated view
(receipt-spec.md §6). Publish/refresh the checkpoint on whatever cadence matches your risk
tolerance; without one, the verifier still runs, but it emits an explicit tail-truncation
warning instead of silently trusting completeness.

## 6. Rotating a key

A `kid` is pinned to `agent.id` **within one chain** the moment the second receipt lands
(`receipt-spec.md` §5 step 4) — a same-chain swap to a different key is rejected as `TAMPERED`
by design, not a bug to work around:

```js
import { generateKeyPair, buildReceipt, verifyChain } from "noa-receipt";

const kp = generateKeyPair("agent-prod-key-1");
const kp2 = generateKeyPair("agent-prod-key-2"); // a second key, wrongly reused mid-chain
const keyring = { [kp.kid]: kp.publicKey, [kp2.kid]: kp2.publicKey };

const buildInputBase = (id) => ({
  id,
  ts: new Date().toISOString(),
  scope: { chain: "checklist:demo" },
  agent: { id: "billing-agent-7", model: "vendor/model-v1", principal: "SERVICE" },
  action: {
    id: "payment.refund",
    canonical: "payment.refund",
    riskClass: "LOW",
    paramsHash: "sha256:" + "0".repeat(64),
    reversible: false,
    rollbackRef: null,
  },
  governance: { mode: "on", verdict: "EXECUTED", ruleId: "low-risk-auto", approval: null, sandboxed: false },
});

const genesis = buildReceipt(buildInputBase("rcpt_0"), null, { kid: kp.kid, privateKey: kp.privateKey });
// same chain, second receipt signed by a different key -> rejected
const second = buildReceipt(buildInputBase("rcpt_1"), genesis, { kid: kp2.kid, privateKey: kp2.privateKey });

const result = verifyChain([genesis, second], { keyring });
console.log(result.status, "|", result.reason);
// -> TAMPERED | key swap for agent "billing-agent-7" (kid agent-prod-key-1 -> agent-prod-key-2)
```

So rotation is a **new chain, not an in-chain edit**: generate a new key pair, start the next
`scope.chain` under the new `kid`, and update the keyring + `identityManifest` to authorize
**both** the retiring and the new `kid` for that `agent.id` (drop the old entry once every
chain signed under it is fully retired and no longer needs re-verification). Redistribute the
updated keyring/manifest through the same out-of-band channel as step 3 — there is no in-band
rotation-attestation yet (an open item tracked in THREAT-MODEL.md, "Cross-agent impersonation").

## 7. What this does *not* give you — read before you rely on it

- **No freshness guarantee.** `ts` is signer-asserted and backdatable; a wholly valid chain can
  be replayed later as if current. Pin an expected chain id/head from a channel you trust *now*.
- **No revocation list.** A leaked private key lets the holder re-sign a fabricated history
  bounded only by a checkpoint someone already holds. Treat key compromise as "rotate + audit
  every chain that key ever signed," not as something the format detects for you.
- **If you gate on `tailChecked`, you must ALSO supply an `identityManifest`.** Without one the
  tail check is **kid-level**: any key your keyring trusts can mint a checkpoint over any head, so
  a co-trusted key holder can drop the most recent receipts, sign a checkpoint over the truncated
  head, and the result is `VALID` with `tailChecked: true`. That verdict is correct for what was
  checked — the checkpoint really did authenticate — and the library warns you at runtime. But a
  pipeline that branches on the boolean and never reads the warnings will not see the difference.

  This is the one gap here that is genuinely yours to close, and it costs one parameter: pass
  `identityManifest` and the §5b genesis binding runs, tying checkpoint authority to the chain's
  OPENER instead of to anyone in the keyring. Receipt spec §6 states the residual that remains even
  then — the opener itself dropping a co-agent's tail — and that one needs the v1.0 external anchor,
  not a parameter.

- **The keyring/manifest are inputs you vouch for**, not something the library derives or
  authenticates on its own — get their distribution wrong and "VALID" stops meaning anything.
