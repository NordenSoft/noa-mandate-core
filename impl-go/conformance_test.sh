# Conformance runner for the from-scratch Go verifier (#41).
#
# Ground truth = impl-py/noa_verify.py, the SECOND independent verifier (its own JCS + its own
# RFC-8032 Ed25519, no shared crypto with the TS reference). For every RECEIPT-vector in
# conformance/golden/0.3.0 + conformance/vectors (incl. attack/ and malformed/) this runs BOTH
# `python3 impl-py/noa_verify.py <args>` AND `impl-go/noa-verify <args>` with IDENTICAL arguments
# and asserts the process EXIT CODES match (0 VALID · 1 UNVERIFIED · 2 TAMPERED · 3 MALFORMED ·
# 5 UNTRUSTED). One mismatch fails the whole run (no partial credit — a single divergence on a
# security verdict is a conformance failure).
#
# Non-receipt fixtures (keyrings, identity manifests, checkpoints, MANIFEST.json, README.md) are
# NOT run as receipt-vectors — they are the auxiliary trust inputs paired with the chains below,
# per conformance/golden/0.3.0/MANIFEST.json + test/verify.test.ts.
