/**
 * THE ENTRY-POINT REGISTRY — every exported function of every package entry point, classified.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT SIX MORE FIXES. Review #2 closed a mechanism. Review #3 found the same class
 * through a different mechanism. Review #4, #5 and #6 did it again — and #6's C2 was literally "the
 * fourth entry point exists, and a fifth". Routing the entry points a reviewer happened to reproduce
 * is not a fix; it is a queue. The reviewer's own words: *a test that fails when a new export takes
 * attacker input without ingesting is worth more than six fixes.*
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. Every function reachable from a package's `exports` map is listed here with a
 * CLASSIFICATION. `entry-point-coverage.test.ts` enumerates the real exports at runtime and fails if:
 *   • an export exists that is not listed here (a NEW export cannot be added silently); or
 *   • a listed export no longer exists (the registry cannot rot); or
 *   • an export classified `ingests` fails its live probe.
 *
 * THE PROBES ARE DYNAMIC, NOT DECLARATIVE. `bytes-in` is not a promise, it is measured. For each such
 * export the coverage test calls it with an argument carrying a COUNTING GETTER and asserts the getter
 * fired **ZERO** times, and calls it again with an argument whose getter throws a REVOKED PROXY and
 * asserts nothing escapes as a raw `TypeError`. A classification that has stopped being true fails.
 *
 * ── THE THRESHOLD MOVED FROM "AT MOST ONCE" TO "ZERO" (2026-07-28) ──────────────────────────────
 * The old class was `ingests` and the old assertion was `reads <= 1`, because the old boundary
 * TRAVERSED a caller object exactly once and the defect being measured was a SECOND, disagreeing
 * read. One read was the best that design could do — reading a live object at all gives the attacker
 * a turn, and the whole of ADR §2.3 is about that turn being the route by which untrusted data
 * executes code.
 *
 * Bytes-in removes the turn. A security-sensitive entry point now takes `Uint8Array | string`, so a
 * caller-owned object is REFUSED at the boundary and its getters never run. The probe threshold is
 * therefore ZERO, and a single fire is a finding — it would mean some path still traverses. Leaving
 * the assertion at `<= 1` would have kept a passing test that no longer measured the property the
 * migration bought.
 *
 * THE CLASSES:
 *   bytes-in       — a security-sensitive entry point taking `Uint8Array | string`. Probed: a caller
 *                    object must be refused with the hostile getter firing ZERO times.
 *   dataless       — every parameter is a primitive / Buffer / absent. Nothing to flip.
 *   producer-inert — takes caller data, and its OUTPUT is not a security verdict; it either signs
 *                    from a snapshot or its result is re-verified downstream before anyone acts on
 *                    it. Requires `why`.
 *   caller-owned   — the parameter is the CALLER'S OWN configuration (its keyring, its store, its
 *                    transport), not evidence supplied by the party being judged. An attacker who
 *                    controls it has already replaced the verifier. Requires `why`.
 *   unrouted       — takes hostile-capable data and does NOT ingest. Every entry here is an OPEN
 *                    FINDING with an owner, not an exemption; `why` must say what it would take.
 *                    The test prints them as a standing report so the count can only go down.
 *
 * ── WHAT A GREEN REGISTRY DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN (added 2026-07-30) ─────────────────────────────
 * ADR-0002 §3 (ratified 2026-07-29) required this correction on four surfaces. `README.md`,
 * `THREAT-MODEL.md` and `NON-CLAIMS.md` got it the same day. THIS FILE — named in that list — did
 * not, and the omission mattered in a specific way: everything above reads like a proof. A class
 * called `bytes-in`, a probe that fires ZERO times, a count that can only go down. A reader who does
 * not already know the architecture would reasonably conclude the registry demonstrates that hostile
 * input cannot reach a decision. It does not.
 *
 * Every classification here is a statement about what happens AFTER `noa-receipt` has loaded. The
 * intrinsic captures the whole scheme rests on are themselves snapshots taken at module evaluation,
 * so an adversary evaluated FIRST hands them a poisoned value to snapshot, and none of the probes
 * below can see it — they run inside the same compromised realm and measure a library that is
 * already lying. Measured and re-runnable: `r7-exploits/o01_preload_includes.mjs`, pinned OPEN.
 *
 * So the in-realm security objective is UNMET and this package makes no in-realm security claim.
 * What the registry genuinely delivers is narrower and still worth having: a NEW export cannot be
 * added without a classification, a classification that has stopped being true fails, and the
 * `unrouted` count is a standing debt rather than a memory. That is hygiene against our own drift.
 * The security property belongs to the isolated Go kernel, which shares no realm with the caller.
