/**
 * THE CLASS TEST — no mutation of any shared intrinsic can turn a rejection into an acceptance.
 *
 * Six reviews, six mechanisms, one class. Freeze the data → the attacker poisons the prototype the
 * frozen data inherits. Fix the mutable Set here → the mutable Sets one file over are untouched.
 * Route three entry points → the fourth and fifth are not routed. Each fix closed the mechanism that
 * had been DEMONSTRATED. None closed the class, because the class was never stated as a property
 * anything measured.
 *
 * Here it is, stated:
 *
 *     for every verifier entry point, every fixture, and every poisonable intrinsic:
 *         poisoning the intrinsic may not make the verdict MORE PERMISSIVE.
 *
 * That is what all six mechanisms had in common. A getter fired during ingestion is attacker code
 * running inside the boundary — unavoidable, since the data lives behind that getter — and the only
 * durable question is what it can reach afterwards. The answer must be: nothing that decides.
 *
 * HOW IT IS MEASURED. For each intrinsic, the poison is installed, the entry point is called over
 * every fixture, and the poison is removed in a `finally`. A poisoned run may return anything EXCEPT
 * a result more permissive than the clean run — reason strings are allowed to differ (a poisoned
 * `Array.prototype.join` legitimately garbles a message), verdicts are not. "More permissive" is
 * defined per entry point by `permissiveness()` below.
 *
 * WHY THIS BEATS SIX MORE FIXES. It does not know about `includes`, `has` or `find`. It enumerates
 * the intrinsics an attacker can reach and asserts the property over all of them, so mechanism seven
 * is already covered — and a NEW call site that reaches for `x.includes(...)` on a decision path
 * turns it red without anyone remembering why the rule exists.

 * nothing, the COSE sink is locked STRUCTURALLY below (`src/cose/cbor.ts` may contain no live

/**
 * ── FOUR MATCHED PAIRS FOR THE ROUND-3 FINDINGS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The generic catalogue above enumerates POISONABLE SLOTS and asserts no verdict gets more
 * permissive. It could not have caught any of these four, for two structurally different reasons,
 * and both are worth stating because they are the reasons a catalogue is never sufficient on its own:
 *
 *   • It poisons PROTOTYPES and GLOBAL OBJECT PROPERTIES. An ESM import binding is neither — it is
 *     repointed by `syncBuiltinESMExports()`, a mechanism no `onProto` call can express (T17).
 *   • A destructive poison fails CLOSED and the suite reads the rejection as health. Three of these
 *     four need a specific FIXTURE to reach an acceptance — a keyring entry whose y = q+1, a policy
 *     whose first rule uses an unknown op, a COSE header declaring alg -7 — and a catalogue that
 *     supplies no fixture cannot reach the branch it is poisoning.
 *
 * So each is written as a MATCHED PAIR: the clean verdict is pinned by exact value (a control that
 * rejects everything must not score), the poison is asserted to have FIRED where that is observable,
 * and the poisoned verdict is pinned too. Every one of them goes RED if its fix is reverted — that is
 * the whole point of writing them, and it is verified by `npm run lint:knockout`.

 * a live `verify` ESM binding and a live `BigInt` sat on the signature verdict unremarked.
