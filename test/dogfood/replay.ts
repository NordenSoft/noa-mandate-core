/**
 * test/dogfood/replay.ts — PRIVATE internal dogfood REPLAY exercise. NOT published (under test/).
 *
 * Re-runs the deterministic INTEGER evaluator (evaluate) over the RECORDED decision inputs and
 * asserts the verdict reproduces BYTE-FOR-BYTE against the receipt's recorded commitment, then
 * confirms the full on-receipt L2 proof (verifyReceiptCompliance: the hashes bind the exact
 * signed policy + the exact recorded inputs, and the re-run verdict reconciles with the recorded
 * one). REUSES evaluate + verifyReceiptCompliance; authors no new replay/commitment/redaction.
 *
 * Honesty line (inherited from the lib): this proves "policy P re-run over the RECORDED inputs I
 * yields verdict V, and V equals the decision the receipt recorded". It is NOT proof the policy
 * was in force at decision time, nor that I is true/complete, nor that P is wise.
