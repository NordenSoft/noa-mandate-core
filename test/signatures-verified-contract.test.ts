/**
 * P1-13 — `signaturesVerified` AND `tailChecked` ARE SUCCESS-QUALIFIERS, NOT PROGRESS REPORTS.
 *
 * ─── THE AMBIGUITY THAT PRODUCED THIS FILE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `fail()` (`src/verify.ts:125`) hardcodes `signaturesVerified: false` at all 35 call sites, and 19
 * of those sit AFTER signature checking begins at `:401`. Read as source, that looks like a lie: a
 * chain can fail at receipt N for a reason that is not cryptographic at all — tenant drift, chain
 * order, a malformed later field — while receipts 1..N-1 authenticated perfectly, and the result
 * still says no signatures were verified.
 *
 * It is not a lie, and the alternative is the actual defect. Under the other reading ("a keyring was
 * supplied, so checking ran") a **TAMPERED verdict would carry `signaturesVerified: true`** — a
 * positive sub-claim riding a failed check. That is the same shape as a CI job reporting success
 * having skipped its tests: **a run that did not complete must never report its sub-checks as
 * passed.** So the field means "this result is backed by COMPLETED authentication of the whole
 * input", the status and `reason` carry how far the run actually got, and `false` on every failure
 * is correct by contract.
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The adjudication changed no behaviour, which is precisely the risk: a contract that lives only in
 * a comment is one refactor away from being "simplified" into the reading it rejected. The two tests
 * below are the exact cases that made the meaning ambiguous — a post-authentication non-cryptographic
 * failure, and a tampered checkpoint over sound receipts — converted from open questions into guards.
 *
 * Existing suites already pin the easy directions (`test/identity-binding.test.ts:48,72` pin false on
 * failure; `mcp-proxy/test/smoke.mjs` asserts the same), and every one of them assumes this reading.
 * What none of them covered is a failure that happens AFTER real signatures verified — which is the
 * only case where the two readings disagree.
