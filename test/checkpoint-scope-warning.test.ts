/**
 * Regression: `tailChecked: true` must not be an unqualified claim.
 *
 * THREAT-MODEL.md ("Re-heading truncation among co-trusted keys", T-tail-reheading) already
 * states the residual honestly: without an `identityManifest`, checkpoint authentication is
 * KID-LEVEL, so *any* keyring-trusted key can forge a checkpoint over any head. The §5b
 * genesis-binding that closes this only runs when a manifest is supplied.
 *
 * The defect this file pins is not the residual itself — it is the RUNTIME SIGNAL. In that
 * configuration `verifyChain` returned:
 *
 *     { status: "VALID", tailChecked: true, warnings: [ fork/equivocation, kid-level-attribution ] }
 *
 * `tailChecked: true` is the field a relying party reads as "the tail was verified", and neither
 * warning tells it that the tail check it just passed is only as strong as the *weakest* holder
 * of any key in the keyring. A co-trusted key can drop the most recent receipts, mint its own
 * checkpoint over the truncated head, and the caller sees an affirmative tail check.
 *
 * The fix is ADDITIVE and changes no verdict: when a checkpoint authenticates but no
 * identityManifest is supplied, the result carries an explicit warning naming the consequence.
 * Verdicts, `tailChecked`, and every existing warning are untouched — this only stops the
 * result object from over-claiming in the one configuration where the doc says it must not.
